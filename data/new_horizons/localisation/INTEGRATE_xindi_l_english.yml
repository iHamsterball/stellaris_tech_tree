 STH_xindi_story.10.desc:0 "Embedded in a twenty kilometre thick chunk of former seabed, the [From.GetFleetName] has discovered the remains of a Xindi-Aquatic fortress. \n\nAmazingly, it appears the fortress survived the destruction of Xindus thanks to the presence of hundreds of primitive structural integrity field generators across its exterior. The internal surveilance grid shows the Xindi-Aquatic garison surviving for nearly twenty years before life support failed following the exhaustion of fortress' deuterium power reserves. \n\nA number of Xindi-Aquatic entertainment videos and music recordings were recovered from the ruins."

Heavily fortified by the Primates, natural duranium deposits made the string of subterranean bases beneath the range almost impervious to attack. \n\nOne such base has been discovered intact on one of the larger fragments of Xindus. \n\nWhile the garison appears to have died shortly after the cataclysm, they each made a number of video recordings detailing their personal lives and family histories, in what whey considered to be the slim hope that alien archeologists might uncover them.
