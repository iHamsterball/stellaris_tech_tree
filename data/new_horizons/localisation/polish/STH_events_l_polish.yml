It is, in fact, one of the most durable ships you will ever be able to build.\n\nBut wait, there's more! The Cruiser is a very capable platform - while it does not have the pure offensive capability of other classes, it does compensate it with the ability to equip a great deal of utilities and even a unique Debuff aura.

It also comes equipped with a unique Short-Range Combat Sensor that gives your ship an extra kick at close range.\n\nDespite having a fire-power comparable to a battleship, it is as small and maneuverable as a destroyer.

More expensive too, and most probably the last ship your puny scientists will be able to develop.\n\nThe Assault Cruiser is as nimble as a much smaller ship, while carrying almost as much defenses as a battleship and the most powerful weapons in your arsenal.

In time you will discover the knowledge of various Colony Modules, that will be activated as soon as the colony is established.\n\nYour first one merely strengthens the hull of the ship, but in time you can install modules such as a prefabricated building module that will instantly build a few structures on your colony, to even stasis chambers that will deliver an additional population to the surface.

Before their extinction, all D'Arsry polities shared many ideals in arts, philosophy and theology while still keeping their own unique histories, languages, government and currency.\n\nDespite this individuality, two names continue to appear consistently in almost every article we have recovered from the archive: Masaka and Korgano, the prime goddess and god of the D’Arsay pan-global pantheon.

 STH_galactic_features.1042.desc:0 "Our researchers are slowly coming to a startling conclusion concerning the D’Arsay people themselves: they were poikilothermic, meaning their bodies and mental states were highly influenced by fluctuation in temperature. This could explain their obsession with the sun, or why Masaka, their sun goddess, was so highly tied with times of brute actions, sacrifice and war.\n\nWe arrive at this conclusion from a careful study of the D’Arsay holographic records of their former cities. It is clear that heat management was paramount – stone buildings designed to convey heat upwards, large, open, flowing chambers meant to carefully distribute heat and sunlight. The drastic distinction between the airy and cool chambers of Korgano and the suffocating fortresses of Maska also now made sense. The very architecture of the buildings and the way they channelled heat would shape the behaviour of everyone in the building."

 STH_mars.101.desc:0 "Even before we could travel the stars, we looked at our nearest planetary neighbor and wondered what life existed there. Hundreds of years later we will find out Mars once had moving rivers and seas, even a basic eco-system, only to lose it to an ever-depleting atmosphere. Now is our chance to restore Mars to its former glory. Even as we look to other solar systems and their wealth of colonizable planets, the Mars Initiative seeks to terraform the red planet. \n\nThe head of the project, engineer Paul Boone, says that with the help of the Verteron Array, it will be possible to nudge comets and asteroids out of their orbit and force them to crash onto the polar ice-cap of Mars. This will release carbon dioxide and water vapor into the atmosphere, and eventually, bring life back to the barren planet. The project lead estimates the project could take at least eight years, and potentially a great deal more.\n\n§GRemember the Verteron Array must be manned by a pop at all times, or your terraforming project will not advance.§!"

 STH_mars.111.desc:0 " 'Sir!' shouted one of the xenopaleobotonists further down the cave. They were located two kilometers below the Martian surface, not far from the edges of the Garni Crater. The entire cave formation was only revealed recently, after an especially rough quake that followed a comet strike brought down the covering walls. The geological structure immediately attracted the attention of local science teams because the cave held trace element of an especially important molecule: water.\n\nPaul Boone, leader of the Mars terraforming initiative, followed the call deeper inside the cave. A small group of researchers were crouched near a small, tapering pillar, whispering excitedly. As he grew closer, he could see the beam of light illuminating a small, shallow pool of water, covered by an organic looking metallic sheen. The biologists were moving their tricorders again and again. There, in the briny water, were millions of fossilized insects. Evidence that Mars did carry life, once upon a time."
 STH_mars.111.a:0 "An incredible find!"
 STH_mars.112.desc:0 "The ground control crew stared helplessly at the monitors. 'Send an evacuation order!' yelled someone, but others were just shaking their head numbly. 'It's too late' muttered someone else.\n\nAn hour ago, is was simply another routine day in the Mars Initiative control center, with no less than five comets scheduled to crash into the ice cap. Then, shortly after contact with the now-thicker atmosphere, an unmapped pocket of volatiles on a comet erupted, sending the comet into a spin. As the comet plunged toward the Martian surface, more and more gas pockets burst. The comet was shredding itself apart, now on a trajectory toward New Armstrong Base. A few ground vehicles managed to escape the base dome in time, but even they didn't survive the ensuing nuclear blast as a comet fragment hit Mars with the strength of 300 megatons of TNT. Fifty thousand people died in what would be known at the worse terraforming disaster of this century."
 STH_mars.112.a:0 "They will not die in vain."
 STH_mars.121.desc:0 "The tension in the control room was palpable. A flotilla of tugs was pulling the last segments of the mirror into position, and even a millimeter misalignment of the 5 kilometer wide complex could ruin the great assembly. Boone paced back and forth along the small chamber, making a small indentation in the carpet. The controller gazed at him, irritated, thought of asking him again to sit down, thought better of it, and continued his work.\n\nTen minutes later, however, there was no more need to worry. The sensor grid reported every single segment was properly aligned. Ponderously, Xeon-plasma jets kicked in, making the final adjustment. Then the mirror was angled just so, and suddenly, pure, blessed sunlight blasted across the Martian surface, reflected from above. Already, surface temperatures were climbing. Boone grinned at the monitor, and hurried to report to his superiors. The controller shook his head, mentally switching his focus to the next mirror complex under construction."
 STH_mars.121.a:0 "These mirrors will usher in a new age for Mars."
 STH_mars.122.desc:0 "The infestation started over two months ago, in the remote reaches of Malea Planum. The southern ice cap was seeded with a highly modified anaerobic bacterium, that injected contaminants in the ice-water, releasing a small amount of heat in the process. There were many genetic safeguards and a very simplistic DNA strand should have been proper protection against mutation. It wasn't.\n\nA freak change in allele activation allowed the bacteria to inject more complex organic molecules. In the past desolate Mars would offer very little in organic material, but Mars surface has been seeded with other strains of bacteria that fertilized the soil. Within a week, the ice-cap bacteria subsumed all other strains, spreading like wildfire along the empty plains of southern Mars. When it was eventually discovered, it was almost too late - the bacteria were everywhere, covering the surface with a thin, grey crust. The damage to the ecosystem is vast - it may very well set back the project for years."
 STH_mars.122.a:0 "We must eradicate it, before all is lost."
 STH_mars.130.desc:0 "A small delegation of researchers is leaving the Terraforming lab. In the distance, explosions can be heard, carried across the thin atmosphere. Engineer Boone glances at his timepiece - comet ZA2112-B crashed into the northern polar ice cap right on schedule. Minor quakes shake the surface and quickly dissipate, and miles-high geysers of superheated steam stretching into the atmosphere. Boone glances at the sight and smiles, before firmly grasping the seals of his breathing masks and pulling it free. The rest of the delegation stare at him warily. This is why they came here, but the risk is still great.\n\nPaul Boone is the first human being to take a fresh breath of Martian air. After years of work, the atmosphere is finally thick enough for a human to breath it unaided. There is still much to do before Mars will truly be a paradise, but this is a monumental step forward for Humanity."

 STH_mars.140.desc:0 "Representatives from all over Mars stood ill at ease in one corner of the mess hall Schiaparelli Base as attendants hurried to drag in more seats. The hall was ill-fitting for such a distinguished occasion, but rugged Mars has yet to manufacture anything else that could house such a large gathering. Finally, they were all allowed to enter.\n\nThe red planet is no more, replaced with something that appears almost green. Thousands of migrants from Earth flock here, and the population is booming. It is clear to everyone something must be done.\n\nA short while later, after the meeting commenced, John Hammerlich, now old and distinguished, stepped in front of the short podium. He was the representative of Gundersdottir's Dome, one of the largest in the 22nd colonies of Mars, and his gravelly voice spoke for all.\n\n'We stand here, not unlike our forefathers did in the grand old city of Philadelphia, not to cast of tyranny but to embrace freedom. We take the first step today, as we make the Fundamental Declarations of the Martian Colonies'."
 STH_mars.140.a:0 "This will not be an easy negotiation."
 STH_mars.141.desc:0 "It was one of the most ambitious articles in the Fundamental Declarations of the Martian Colonies. As the terraforming process progressed, more and more resources shifted to Mars. The air was still thin, but people could walk unaided on the surface and truly tame this new world. The confederated Martian colonies have decided they will initiate a construction project that will rival any of that on Earth.\n\nA lucky draw picked Utopia colony, a tiny hamlet on the Utopia Planitia lava plane, as the site. Within a month, the small town was transformed. Within two months, the foundations of a superstructure were placed 16 thousand kilometers above the colony, in synchronous orbit. Now, the Utopia Planitia Fleet Yards fill the sky with dozens of giant drydocks."
 STH_mars.141.a:0 "This is truly inspiring."
 STH_mars.142.desc:0 "It was one of the most heated contested articles in the Fundamental Declarations of the Martian Colonies. Mars was transforming under the comet barrage of the Mars Initiative, becoming a paradise for humanity, but at what price? That was, at least, the question a vocal group called 'the preservers' were asking. They called terraforming an abomination, man exerting its influence over another pristine land, one it has no right to call home. As the Preservers gained power, the newly founded senate of the Confederated Martian Colonies grew concerned.\n\nEventually and under constant pressure from the public, the senate agreed to a wide range of regulations that will severely limit the extent of the Mars Initiative. No one seemed happy with the solution, and the terraforming of Mars has been delayed for years."
 STH_mars.142.a:0 "We must respect their views."
 STH_mars.143.desc:0 "Years ago, when there was still a Pope in Rome, when the last Pope died, the cardinals would gather and debate who would be his successor. They were not allowed to leave until a decision could be made. Once, it almost took three years... thank goodness, it did not take so long this time. It only felt that way said Hammerlich ponderously, to polite laughter. In truth, everyone felt on edge - the negotiations, initially expected to be brief and cordial, quickly turned ugly.\n\nYet in the end, the key disputes - access to future water-ways - was agreed upon, and from there, things progressed quickly and an accord was met. Mars now has its own constitution and federal government, independent but forever bound to Earth. The destiny of a world was decided, and for once in humanity's history, it was not decided with blood."
 STH_mars.143.a:0 "It was a long process, but at least it is over."

But well before that, the venerable annex will already be a bastion of research and academia.\n\nInspired by the pioneering spirit of old and the new Fundamental Declaration charter, the local Martians have decided they must be able to rival Earth not only in industry but in their contribution to mankind as well. This vision lasted into the future, making Mars one of the most respected scientific institutes in the galaxy."
 STH_mars.151.a:0 "A remarkable building."
 STH_mars.152.desc:0 "In hindsight, it was not clear what the rebellion was even about. Mars was flourishing under the Initiative, but the older settlers, those that lived on Mars for dozens of years before the flood of migrants from Earth, grew even more resentful. Was it about land? Control? Power? Preserving the old ways? All the above, or none? All we know is that almost overnight, the planet was in frenzy, riots on every dome.\n\nThe overwhelmed local government tried to control the situation, but before anyone even noticed, an armed group of local colonists stormed the Verteron Array compound, gaining access to a weapon of terrific puissance. With a single, defiant act, they shuttered the Initiative, halting the project and rallying rebels across the planet."
 STH_mars.152.a:0 "We have no choice. Contact M.A.C.O HQ."
 STH_mars.154.desc:0 "The strike, when it came, was over swiftly. What took several weeks of careful planning, lasted less than a single violent, intense hour. A M.A.C.O team infiltrated the Verteron Array compound at several locations at the same times using a transporter technique that by-passed the inhibitor field. Despite a few casualties, most of the rebels surrendered on the spot.\n\nThe rest of the Martian rebellion did not last much more. A few enclaves held out, but most surrendered when news came of the fall of the compound. The Martian colonies were at peace once again, and within a few days the terraforming resumed.\n\nThe seeds of discontent, however, will not disappear as swiftly.

 country.53.desc.borg:0 "Our recent assimilation of unique pre-sentient species has led analysis nodes within the Collective to indicate the presence of other nearby species of unique ability. These creatures were detected on surveyed habitable worlds, but they are difficult to capture due to their capacity to elude our sensors or local environmental constraints. It will require the full resources of a Survey Vessel for a lengthy period of time."

 country.54.desc.borg:0 "After an extensive search of the seabed on [From.From.GetName] using a small fleet of aquatic drones, the [Root.GetName] has finally managed to corner the target of the Collective's search - a live tarblac. \n\nThe shimmering creature, which defends itself by emitting faint psionic signals that produce a sense of dread in most organic species, was brought aboard the Science Vessel in a special water tank simulating its natural environment. Drones which have come into direct contact with the tarblac will require software patching, but the operation has been a success."
 country.55.desc.borg:0 "The tassargoid is an extremely lethal predator that stalks the dense jungles of [From.From.GetName] at night, paralyzing its prey with electric shocks before sucking their brains out with its tube-like mouth.\n\nThree drones from the [Root.GetName] were lost to these creatures before a specimen could be secured."
 country.56.desc.borg:0 "The small, rodent-like creatures known as orinthi are native to [From.From.GetName], where their habitat extends across most of the [From.From.GetPlanetMoon]'s diverse climatic regions. They breed at an extremely rapid rate, and seem to have a particular fondness for chewing on EPS cables.\n\nProcuring specimens was not a problem - in fact, after the initial creatures were collected, more of them made their way onto the [Root.GetName] by attaching themselves to our drones prior to their beaming back to the Science Vessel."
 country.57.desc.borg:0 "Snirans are large, burrowing creatures that live beneath the dunes of the vast equatorial deserts on [From.From.GetName]. When these predators sense movement in the sands above, they immediately raise dozens of tall spikes from their backs in the hope of impaling something edible.\n\nFinding a suitable specimen proved difficult at first, until hundreds of drones were dispatched across the desert in random directions. This led to the discovery and procurement of an unusually large specimen that had grown more than a hundred spikes on its back."
 country.58.desc.borg:0 "Goolanthas are large, flat herbivores that have evolved internal gas pockets, enabling them to hover a few centimeters above the ground. They move about in herds consisting of a few dozen animals, grazing on the moss and lichen that can be found on the windswept plains of [From.From.GetName].\n\nThey are ruthlessly hunted by the [From.From.GetPlanetMoon]'s apex predators, and local analysis units estimate that only a few hundred goolantha herds remain. One of these, consisting of nine animals, has been successfully collected and will be brought back to [Root.Owner.Capital.GetName] for full assimilation."
 country.59.desc.borg:0 "Drones from the [Root.GetName] have managed to collect a small group of uddlorans from the icy surface of [From.From.GetName]. These white, furry omnivores wrap themselves into tight balls and roll across the [From.From.GetPlanetMoon]'s snow fields at astonishing speeds - one animal was detected with a velocity of 81.4 kilometers per decacycle. This aided in their detection, since the passage of their rolling forms raised huge plumes of swirling snow."
 country.60.desc.borg:0 "The Zulcor are swarming insect analogues, unusual both for their large size and the fact that they are lithovores, feeding off rocks and minerals in the ground.

Their energy cores are by far the sturdiest component used in their construction, and some were recovered by the Collective. The technology behind these cells is surprisingly advanced and resistant to assimilation, but initial tests show we are quite capable of converting their output to Energy. \n\nAs the final energy cell bled out, our own drones handling the tests noticed a dip in background radiation. It would appear that the ancient mining drones are not silent, but have been sporadically broadcasting on unusual frequencies since we first encountered them, possibly ever since they were first deployed. It is unlikely that there is anyone left to receive these transmissions.\n\nThe drones could prove to be a potent but limited source of energy, should we be able to find and disable them efficiently enough."

 anomaly.1.desc.borg:0 "Although the Collective's data archives have examined it repeatedly, all calculations point towards asteroid [From.GetName] being coprolite - a piece of fossilized feces from some kind of massive life form. It appears to be almost a billion years old, and much of the fossil's original organic composition has been replaced by mineral deposits. The mineral deposits will be useful to the Collective."
 anomaly.5.desc.borg:0 "This asteroid appears to have been used intermittently as a base by imperfect beings one thousand cycles ago. A drone retrieval team entered the base and managed to recover abandoned material. It consisted largely of crude trinkets and artifacts, but some of it may be of value to the Collective."
 anomaly.5.a.borg:0 "It will be assimilated."
 anomaly.10.desc.borg:0 "Whilst conducting a survey of [From.GetName], the drones of the [Root.GetName] picked up several life signs coming from within the asteroid. There appears to be a colony of large burrowing worm-like lithovores within the rock, which has been riddled with tunnels. These unique imperfect life forms have somehow adapted to a life in the coldness of space."
 anomaly.10.a.borg:0 "Their biological distinctiveness will be added to our own."
 anomaly.15.desc.borg:0 "Fossils from what appears to be several species of aquatic lifeforms have been found on the barren and airless surface of [From.GetName]. There are indications that the surrounding asteroid belt was created from the remains of a shattered planet, and these findings seem to confirm that theory. Calculations via the fossils indicate this planet once supported life and was at least partially covered by water."
 anomaly.25.desc.borg:0 "A large portion of asteroid [From.GetName] has been hollowed out to allow for the construction of some kind of shipyard. It has been abandoned and exposed to the vacuum of space for hundreds of cycles - we have not detected anything useful onboard. The design of the shipyard itself is unique, however, and much could potentially be learned by its assimilation."
 anomaly.25.a.borg:0 "The technological distinctiveness will be added to our own."
 anomaly.30.desc.borg:0 "This asteroid was used as a junkyard by imperfect beings in the distant past. All manner of discarded machinery and metallic refuse has been deposited inside the asteroid's weak gravity well, being slowly pulled into the jumble of debris that now covers the surface. There is nothing of particular value to be found here, but a lot of the metal could be salvaged by a mining station to add to the Collective."
 anomaly.30.a.borg:0 "It will be assimilated."
 anomaly.35.desc.borg:0 "A small scout craft of unknown design plowed into the surface of this asteroid millennia ago, creating a shallow canyon. There is no visible cockpit on the ship, leading the Collective to understand it was either piloted by remote or through some kind of primitive artificial intelligence. Although it is too damaged to be recovered in it's entirety, the ship may still contain useful information to the Collective."

 anomaly.40.desc.borg:0 "Sensor nodes have detected an automated mining base built in close orbit around asteroid [From.GetName]. There is scorching on the hull indicative of light weapons damage, and the facility appeared to be stuck in some kind of feedback loop. Our drones have managed to reprogram the base systems and the facility is now fully assimilated."
 anomaly.40.desc.alt.borg:0 "Sensor nodes have detected an automated mining base built in close orbit around asteroid [From.GetName]. There are large chunks of the hull missing, the jagged holes indicative of heavy weapons damage. The station is beyond repair, but salvaging it will provide the Collective with valuable materials."
 anomaly.50.desc.borg:0 "Asteroid [From.GetName] is pockmarked with craters from weapon blasts, and appears to have been used as a target range by an unknown species roughly two thousand cycles ago. Residual energy readings suggest they tested increasingly exotic weaponry, including subspace bombs and some kind of singularity generator. Analysis of the unusual weapon echoes may prove useful to the Collective."
 anomaly.55.desc.borg:0 "Upon closer examination, drones have discovered that a smaller asteroid consisting almost entirely of rare precious metals recently collided with [From.GetName]. A small but dense cache of metals was hidden just beneath the asteroid's surface, but now that it has been discovered it is accessible to mining drones."
 anomaly.55.a.borg:0 "The minerals will service us."
 anomaly.60.desc.borg:0 "This particular asteroid is an extrasolar capture, and appears to have been washed by some kind of exotic radiation as it plummeted through interstellar space before finally settling in the [From.GetStarName] system. The original source of this radiation remains unknown to the Collective, but the [Root.GetName] has been able to pick up a wealth of physics data useful to the Collective by studying the asteroid's energy emissions."
 anomaly.65.desc.borg:0 "After identifying an anomaly in the gravity well of [From.GetName], the [Root.GetName] has discovered the shattered wreckage of an ancient ore superfreighter buried deep within the asteroid's crust. Sensor nodes detect that the cargo is on the surface and the asteroid's mineral wealth has been recategorised accordingly."
 anomaly.300.desc.borg:0 "The Collective has discovered a thriving ecosystem in the upper atmosphere of the gas giant [From.GetName]. Massive floating creatures, having evolved bodies filled with lighter than air gases, follow the wind currents and feed off the energy released by the gas giant's frequent lightning storms. These beings in turn support colonies of smaller animals that prey on atmospheric plankton and each other."
 anomaly.305.desc.borg:0 "A discarded cargo pod was left by someone in the upper atmosphere of [From.GetName] long ago. It has somehow escaped the notice of other spacefarers, and its decaying orbit means it would have been lost in the gas giant's crushing atmosphere within another few cycles. When the drones of the [Root.GetName] unsealed the pod, they found a stash of alien jewelry made out of precious metals, these metals could be refined to service us."
 anomaly.310.desc.borg:0 "A small aerostat colony was found floating just above the atmosphere of [From.GetName]. Sensor sweeps indicate it to have been self-sufficient, and remains from several different species were found on board.\n\nFurther analysis indicates the colony was some kind of social experiment conducted centuries ago that ultimately ended with the colonists massacring each other. We have assimilated all of the data found in the colony's limited databanks and added them to the Collective."
 anomaly.315.desc.borg:0 "A ruined network of aerostat colonies dating back at least three millennia can be found in low orbit of this gas giant. Their original function appears to have been gas mining, but they have since been abandoned and reoccupied by many different races and pirate groups.\n\nThe colonies have been thoroughly stripped of anything even remotely valuable, but the mere fact that they are still aloft after all this time makes them an interesting subject of knowledge to assimilate."
 anomaly.320.desc.borg:0 "The strong gravity well of [From.GetName] has pulled in a massive amount of space debris which has formed a dense layer around parts of the gas giant. Most of it appears to be wreckage from a series of space battles fought in the system several millennia ago.\n\nScavengers have already scoured the debris of valuable technologies and artifacts, but a mining station should be able to recycle the metal and add it to serve the Collective."
 anomaly.325.desc.borg:0 "The shattered remnants of a primitive starship can be detected in a decaying orbit deep inside the atmosphere of [From.GetName]. It appears to have ventured far into the gas giant's atmosphere, perhaps in a desperate attempt to escape a pursuer, only to be crushed by the atmospheric pressure.\n\nThe vessel is too deep to be assimilated, but a structural sensor sweep of the wreckage has provided us with some interesting engineering data which we could add to the Collective."
 anomaly.325.a.borg:0 "It's technological distinctiveness will be added to our own."
 anomaly.330.desc.borg:0 "[From.GetName] frequently experiences massive and extremely violent storm systems in its atmosphere. Several dozen persistent storms are visible from orbit, with winds often reaching speeds in excess of 700 m/s. The cause of these storms is not immediately apparent, as we have found nothing in the planet's climate model that would explain them. The Collective is interested in analyzing this anomaly."
 anomaly.335.desc.borg:0 "The [Root.GetName] has picked up a strange energy signature coming from somewhere deep inside the atmosphere of [From.GetName]. It appears to originate from a structure of some kind, possibly the remains of an orbital station, but the atmospheric pressure makes it impossible to approach. Nevertheless, scans of the unique signature have yielded a large amount of valuable physics data which will be added to the Collective."
