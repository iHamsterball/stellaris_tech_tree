 START_SCREEN_TRA:0 "Since time immemorial we have used our great cultural prowess to sow divisions in the lines of our enemies, to leave them bickering and squabbling amongst themselves.\n\nOur most prestigious triumph has been the discovery of the strong and ill tempered Kazon, a once united race now reduced to infighting amongst themselves over the scraps we provide. Our civilisation is built on our ability to stay united and to utilise these lesser beings as fuel for our economy.\n\nAs we discover faster warp drives, we will extend our reach into the stars once more, to seek out new life and new civilisations, to swiftly divide and conquer for the good of the Trabe Alliance."

A local bacteriophage that was once limited to rare fungi found only on the Northern icescapes mutated abruptly and became a highly virulent and ravaging disease.\n\nThe medical science of the Vidiians couldn't keep up with the mutation of the disease that came to be known simply as the Phage. In the millennia since, the Vidiian have sacrificed their ideals and their art in the pursuit of a cure, erected new methods of quarantines and even more brutal medical procedures, to no avail. This, more than anything, has shaped the modern Vidiian culture."

Our identity, when the Phage eats us from the inside out, until we are too hideous to be seen even by our fellows. Our future, snatched away far too soon. Our dreams, to have a natural life, a happy life, our choices to have any vocation but a Phage-fighter - whatever in our ships, plying for more organs, or in the labs, trying to seek the impossible.\n\nAll that, and more, we sacrifice to the Phage, and we would gladly sacrifice our lives as well, so that we can keep just one thing to ourselves.

 gov_darsay_converts_desc:0 "Under the light of the Waxing Cycle and the rule of the God Emperor are stretched the Kingdoms of D'Arsay, as numerous as the stars in the sky. The D'Arsay Federal government, composed of the Emperor themselves and the advisory Council of Clans, holds in theory ultimate power. In practice, however, the D'Arsay people retain much of their original, ancient and proud civilisation. The D'Arsay culture grew in the time of peace, many millennia ago, that brought about the slow unification of many small kingdoms, villages and tribes. All of them now share a common elite culture, rich in iconography, architecture and mythology, but most still have their own heritage, language and currency. "
 gov_stagnant_democracy:0 "Ancient Democracy"
 gov_stagnant_democracy_desc:0 "A noble attempt to merge together the governments of several cooperating species, the First Federation roots range back over 50,000 years. The original government was a myriad collection of direct democracy ideals together with highly complex compromises ensuring every species had a say in the running of the Federation. The millennia since then, as the Federation sunk into decline, seclusion and ennui, has only complicated matters further.\n\nThe result is a system heavy with rituals, customs, bureaucracy and procedure, requiring approval from multiple local community forums and elective regional archons. The leader of the First Federation, the President, has only the powers of a figure head, while the very little actual power is fought over by the various committees. The Parliament of Parishes, that has a single volunteer representative from each region, is currently the most powerful body – but it has nearly 150 thousand members."

 gov_high_council:0 "High Council"
 gov_high_council_desc:0 "Ever since the death of Kahless, the Klingon Empire has been ruled by the High Council - a militaristic and feudal form of oligarchy, steeped in tradition and honor. Sometimes named the Klingon High Command, all decisions concerning the state are taken by the Chancellor. He rules by the will of the Council, representing 24 of the great houses in the Empire."
 gov_krenim_imperium:0 "Technochronatic Empire"
 gov_krenim_imperium_desc:0 "The Krenim Imperium government is an odd mixture of enlightened technocratic principles with a highly militaristic autocracy. All citizens are expected to serve in the military, but that establishment is remarkably open to supporting and financing works of art and scientific research. Many military commanders are also artists or scientists. From this unique attitude the Temporal Defense Agency sprung forth, benefitting from complete access to both a roster of creative, motivated scientists and the vast funds reserved to military applications. The Agency is now the largest department of the Imperium, in charge of creating a stable and prosperous future of the Imperium."
 gov_detapa_council:0 "Civilian Council"
 gov_detapa_council_desc:0 "The Detapa Civilian Council of the Cardassian Union started as a nominally democratic executive body, in theory in direct control over the Cardassian High Command and the Obsidian Order. In time, however, government the dividing line between the civil administration and the military blurred, then disappeared. The eleven members of the Council are selected by a democratic vote, but they are still nothing more than puppets in a vast military machine."
 gov_romulan_senate:0 "Romulan Senate"
 gov_romulan_senate_desc:0 "The Romulan Star Empire has endured for two thousand years, and in that time it has hardly changed, with new governmental organizations and structured layering one atop another. The public face of the government is the Senate, with senators selected as long-term representatives of their provinces. There are no term limits to a Romulan senator and thus they can spend decades squabbling over position and power. The truly powerful ones maneuver themselves into a seat on the shadowy continuing committee, that has the power to derail the career of any senator and even to select the next Praetor."
 gov_great_link:0 "The Great Link"
 gov_great_link_desc:0 "There are no words to describe the Great Link, the heart and soul of the Dominion. It is not a single entity. The governmental edifice that has slowly accrued around it, to manage the business of the lesser species that make up the Dominion, is no less convoluted. Yet, despite it all, the Link prevails, and even thrives."
 gov_vedek_assembly:0 "Council of Ministers"
 gov_vedek_assembly_desc:0 "Nominally a democracy governed by an elected chamber of ministers, the long-lasting Bajoran Second Republic is in fact headed by several political bodies that each share a sphere of influence and control. Each body is headed by prominent members of a certain D'jarra caste. In the last few centuries, the main foci of power lay within the Vedek Assembly, high-ranking priests that are led by the Kai, the highest religious authority in the Republic."
 gov_ferengi_board:0 "Corporate Oligarchy"
 gov_ferengi_board_desc:0 "The Ferengi Alliance is a unique and highly unstructured government, which promotes a mostly unregulated laissez-faire economy coupled with a highly democratic constitution that grants every citizen - or at least every male citizen - equal opportunities under the Bill of Opportunities. The Alliance is ultimately ruled by a Grand Nagus that may appoint his own successor, but the Nagus is limited by the Board of Liquidators of the Ferengi Commerce Association and the fact he holds very little actual authority."
 gov_deliberative_democracy:0 "Deliberative Democracy"
 gov_deliberative_democracy_desc:0 "Cherishing diversity of opinions as well as a good argument, the Tellarite government is a pure reflection of the species - bewildering, conflicting and yet strangely effective. Unlike most representative democracies, the Technocracy does not have an executive body or base its decision making on majority votes. Instead, the elected governors meet in the grand forum every day to debate policy, enacting new rules and resolutions only when they reach sufficient consensus."
 gov_sheliak_corporate:0 "Corporatocracy"
 gov_sheliak_corporate_desc:0 "The Sheliak Corporate is a misnomer - it is neither a proper interstellar government nor a capitalist conglomerate. The silicon-based species cares very little for material wealth, but instead value precision and efficiency. The Corporate was established by several academic concerns on Shelia for the sole purpose of dictating all regulation involved with interstellar affairs, including colonization, commerce and diplomacy. While the Corporate is not in charge of enforcement or execution, the strict adherence of all Sheliak to the scripture of the law makes the Corporate the de-facto government."
 gov_constitutional_empire:0 "Constitutional Empire"
 gov_constitutional_empire_desc:0 "After a long, graceful transition from a militant planetary empire to a space-bound constitutional monarchy, the queen-emperor of the Andorian Empire chooses to die heirless and divest all power to the Parliament. Centuries later, the Empire is now a pure representative democracy in all but name. The Empty Throne still resides in a chamber of Parliament Hall and acts as the figurative head of state, while the Chancellor rules the Empire."
 gov_borg_unimatrix:0 "Anarcho-Syndicalist Communities"
 gov_borg_unimatrix_desc:0 "In the dream, everyone is equal. Once Unimatrix Zero became a reality, the former dreamers sought to preserve this equality in their new utopia. The Commune is firmly guided by moralistic principles, solidarity and non-violence. Almost all decisions are decided on the local level by a direct democratic vote, with very few powers vested in the global, representative government that guides and protects the Unimatrix denizens as a whole."
 gov_borg_cooperative:0 "Ex-Drone Cooperative"
 gov_borg_cooperative_desc:0 "The Cooperative retains many of the augments and communication devices and infrastructure of the former Collective, which allows the ex-drones to still create a highly capable and response direct democracy. While this form of government can be myriad in indecision, the Cooperative has clear guidelines that allow local leaders to act when needed, often ceasing a great deal of temporal power. While there is certainly an enormous potential for future abuse, so far, the Cooperative functions well, as every ex-drone remembers the horror of their lack of individuality, and will never dream of limiting the freedom of their compatriots."
 gov_borg_cyborg:0 "Holy Machine Empire"
 gov_borg_cyborg_desc:0 "In millennia past, there have been numerous Holy Empires where the Leader was worshipped as an infallible living god. When that Leader is an eternal, mechanical being of great intellect, however, something truly different emerges. The Leader represents everything the Collective ever aspired to be but never succeeded, and it is the centre of every facet of the new Empire. With its great computational speed and full, remote access to every ex-drone, the Leader is also capable of making almost every decision in the Empire."
 gov_elder_council:0 "Elder Council"
 gov_elder_council_desc:0 "The Kelpien government is a unique combination of a fully egalitarian society where every member of the herd is equal, elder worship and ancient feudal roots. The Kelpien never had a war between them, but their original roots stem in local, nomadic herds that clung together for protection. Millennia ago, those small kingdom/herds, or duchies as they become known, swore allegiance to the ancient Empire - ruled by a small collection of Kelpien that were brave and skilled enough to protect the other duchies from predators. In time, the Empire became a free union where each duchy is represented by an Elder Kelpien with senses developed to an almost mystical ability. Nowadays, the Elders are selected by popular vote, but they are still, more often the naught, true Elders."
 gov_ministry_elder:0 "Ministry of Elders"
 gov_ministry_elder_desc:0 "The Voth Ministry of Elders watches over the many Circles of Voth society, ensuring that Doctrine, the ancient tales that tell of Voth supremacy and divine right over the galaxy, is adhered to. Any threats to Doctrine are dealt with quickly, and robustly, which does stifle development but ensures the way of life of the Elders is not threatened."
 gov_circle_matrons:0 "Circle of Matrons"
 gov_circle_matrons_desc:0 "Skrreean society men deems that men are too emotional to be effective leaders, and as such are relegated to a subservient position. The Circle of Matrons, some of the most prominent women on the planet, ensure that female led superiority cannot be threatened and works to actively promote the superiority of Skrreean culture."
 gov_curator_council:0 "Curator Council"
 gov_curator_council_desc:0 "The Curator Council was once but a small, if highly respected, arm of the Hur'Q Domain government. The Council was a loose body that represented the leaders, fleet admirals and ship captains of the great Museums of Hur'Q - vast, floating, nomadic ships that harvested, scavenged, curated and displayed biological beings and technological advances from across the galaxy. After the fall of the Domain and the Purge, the only Hur'Q left alive in the galaxy were the few museum Curators that had the wisdom to flee to the corners of the galaxy. Over centuries, those fleets slowly returned, establishing a new government, a council of the most powerful, ruthless and cunning Curator-War-Captains."
 gov_khanate:0 "Khanate"
 gov_khanate_desc:0 "True to its name, the Augments Khanate government is not that dissimilar from the ancient Khanate of which its draws its name from. Both then, and now, the Khanate has been mistaken to be nothing more than a squabbling group of powerful warlords under the command of a single Great Khan, king of kings, with power being held only by those that seize it.\n\nIn truth, the Augments respect strength and genetic purity but also order and logic. The Great Khan is elected in a democratic vote by all the different Khans, and while the Great Khan can designate a heir, any Khan may challenge that by calling a moot - and voting to replace the new Great Khan."
 gov_ruling_conclave:0 "Ruling Conclave"
 gov_ruling_conclave_desc:0 "The Tholians maintain that their form of government is the highest level of democracy found in the galaxy. All local matters are decided by a local forum, or Lattice, representing all local Tholians in a direct democracy. Members of each Lattice also choose Magistrates, that make decisions in case of emergencies or deal with all external matters. Tholian ship captains are chosen by their peers, in a similar fashion. The Tholian Assembly is ruled by several organizations made by volunteering Magistrates, that are chosen for life to serve in their new post by virtue of merit and performance. The highest organization is the Ruling Conclave, that has little executive power but holds the entire knowledge of every Lattice in the Assembly."
 gov_medical_directorate:0 "Medical Directorate"
 gov_medical_directorate_desc:0 "This Vidiian Sodality is nominally a representative democracy with an elected civilian body. In practice, the Sodality is a brutal, materialistic and highly specific form of oligarchy. The entire governmental apparatus deals with the pursuit of a cure to the Phage and the procurement of replacement organs, at the cost of everything else. Those agencies are under the control of an advisory of committee of medical practitioners and biological researchers that holds a huge amount of power, and de facto rules the Sodality."
 gov_commission:0 "Purity Commission"
 gov_commission_desc:0 "This government is a form of oligarchy that is rabidly obsessed with genetic research and superiority. While they do not see their own species as superior to other lifeforms in the galaxy, they are entirely assured that a significant minority of their own population, due to gender, ethnicity, nationality or phenotype, is inferior. The entire government is built around the preservation of those ingrained notions and divisions between superiors and inferior members of society."
 gov_virtual_democracy:0 "Virtual Democracy"
 gov_virtual_democracy_desc:0 "While all Bynars are linked to each other via their connection with the Central Computer, they are not a single organism. Each Bynar pair still has its own distinct personality, and Bynar's government is in fact a highly active direct democracy facilitated via the instantaneous connection with Central Computer. Nearly every decision voted on by Bynar's from across the Domains, and furious arguments can sometime last for several heated nanoseconds."
 gov_federal_republic:0 "Federal Republic"
 gov_federal_republic_desc:0 "A warp-age Federal Republic is an interstellar union of semi-autonomous states that agree to exist under a single central government and governed by a unified constitution that ensures universal rights, liberty and equality. The Federal government is responsible for all diplomatic interactions with external powers and as well as the coordination and creation of a mutual defensive fleet, although many states still operate their own local law forces, militias and navies."
 gov_tal_patriarchy:0 "Patriarchal Republic"
 gov_tal_patriarchy_desc:0 "The Talarian political structure is rigidly patriarchal, in which females in the society can never outrank a male. War and competition also play an important role in Talarian culture, and warrior-like behavior is strongly encouraged in males."
 gov_aca_sovereignty:0 "Elected Sovereign"
 gov_aca_sovereignty_desc:0 "After centuries of old feuds and devastating wars, most of the Acamarian clans have come together in the realization that despite their internal grievances, they need a unified that will represent the world in all its interstellar dealings. The federal government holds little power, with checks and balances keeping most of the power in the hands of the Ruling Council – which grants seats to every recognized clan in the world. The Sovereign, the nominal head of the federal government, is elected by direct popular vote."
 gov_ate_shoalassembly:0 "Shoal Assembly"
 gov_ate_shoalassembly_desc:0 "The aquatic nature of the Antedian people results in natural migration patterns that remain to this day. The citizens tend to flock together in large, dynamic shoals. Whilst individual shoals have their own leader, a representative is elected from the shoal leaders to assume a leadership position as Pathfinder to lead the Antedians into the vast ocean of space. The highly intricate and convoluted society of the Antedians is generally optimistic, transparent and positive, but it also harbors many dark currents."
 gov_saurian_league:0 "Saurian League"
 gov_saurian_league_desc:0 "Spurred by early contact with other space-faring trading species, the Saurian's various nation states quickly banded together for better distribution of commercial rights and access to Sauria's few working spaceports. The result was the Global League, a much more grand name than it was deserving, considering it did not even represent all the nation states. Still, it was the first step into what would become a truly unified and global Federal Republic."

 pc_invisible_star:0 "Interstellar Space"
 pc_invisible_star_desc:0 "The interstellar medium is composed of multiple phases, distinguished by whether matter is ionic, atomic, or molecular, and the temperature and density of the matter. \n\nComposed primarily of hydrogen, the thermal pressures of these phases are in rough equilibrium with one another. \n\nMagnetic fields and turbulent motions also provide pressure in the interstellar medium, and are typically more important dynamically than the thermal pressure is."
 pc_d_star_binary:0 "Class D Star"
 pc_d_star_binary_desc:0 "These are evolved stars of low luminosity, usually referred to as white dwarfs. They are compact stars with large masses at incredibly small sizes, which gives rise to very high density."
 pc_a_star_binary:0 "Class A Star"
 pc_a_star_binary_desc:0 "These relatively young white or bluish-white main-sequence stars are typically among the most visible to the naked eye. They are large and rotate very quickly, but will eventually evolve into slower and cooler red giants."

 pc_g_star_binary_desc:0 "Often referred to as yellow dwarves, G-type stars actually range in color from white to slightly yellow. Main-sequence stars fuse hydrogen for roughly 10 billion years before they expand and become red giants. Although their lifespans are shorter than K-type stars, worlds inside the habitable zone of a G star often enjoy optimal conditions for the development of life."
 pc_k_star_binary:0 "Class K Star"
 pc_k_star_binary_desc:0 "These main-sequence stars, sometimes referred to as orange dwarves, are a fairly common sight. They are stable on the main-sequence for up to 30 billion years, meaning that worlds orbiting a K-type star have a longer than average window to evolve life."
 pc_m_star_binary:0 "Class M Star"
 pc_m_star_binary_desc:0 "The most common stars in the universe, they are often referred to as red dwarves and some are as old as the galaxy. Their low luminosity means they are difficult to observe with the naked eye from afar. Although they typically have an extremely long lifespan, red dwarfs emit almost no UV light resulting in unfavorable conditions for most forms of life."

Utilising cryogenically frozen Hydrogen, it is sent in and through a fusion reactor conduit, creating the superheated-energetic excited plasma, which is then thrown through a magnetically confined accelerator at a constant rate, creating a plasma beam. Due to plasma's high temperatures, it is effective towards ship armor, however due this more energy is needed to control and confine the beam of superheated plasma."
