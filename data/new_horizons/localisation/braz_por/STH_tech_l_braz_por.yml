 tech_physics_field_manipulation_196:0 "Multi-Adaptive Shielding"
 tech_physics_field_manipulation_196_desc:0 "We have discovered a way of phasing a shield matrix that totally absorbs all common active sensor beams, rendering a ship virtually undetectable, unless more specialised scanning techniques are applied. Unfortunately, it introduces feedback into the matrix reducing its effectiveness. We have found a way of boosting force field strength by introducing controlled feedback into the field."

 tech_physics_modulating_89:0 "Frequência de Escudo Modular"
 tech_physics_modulating_89_desc:0 "In order to form a protective shield, all of a ship's shield emitters must operate at the same frequency. If a weapons frequency matches the shield frequency, it will pass through the shield unhindered. Theoretically the opposite is true; given a weapons frequency there is a shield frequency that will negate it with the least loss to shield cohesion, if any."
 tech_physics_field_manipulation_194:0 "Triaxilating Extendable Shields"
 tech_physics_field_manipulation_194_desc:0 "Shield emitters have struggled to maintain the coherence of medium range graviton beams. The higher the graviton density of the beam, the sooner it dissipates. If the emitters were refit with a triaxilating graviton beam behaving in a similar way to other triaxilating energy patterns, it should gain a more stable cohesion, increasing the rate that nearby ships shields can be reinforced at."
 tech_physics_paratrinic_95:0 "Escudo Defletor Paratrínico"
 tech_physics_paratrinic_95_desc:0 "New developments in multi-spatial shield emitter engineering and extensive experiments with refractive shielding have lead shield harmonics specialists to create a new type of shield geometry which more efficiently absorbs destructive energy and refracts some of it into subspace. These shields can be re-energized with more efficiency than most common shields, granting an increased recharge rate."
 tech_physics_field_manipulation_205:0 "Covariant Pulse Shield Generator"
 tech_physics_field_manipulation_205_desc:0 "The stacked graviton layers of a covariant shield suffer from an inter-layer interference phenomenon. When emitting gravitons into the shield matrix, each layer a graviton must travel through consumes extra power. The problem can be partially mitigated, but not solved, by emitting higher energy pulses to maintain one layer at a time, starting from the furthest out."
 tech_physics_radial_103:0 "Compensador de Força Radial"
 tech_physics_radial_103_desc:0 "When the shield absorbs destructive energies, the ship's hull receives some mechanical feedback through the emitters. A specialised type of inertial dampener, called a radial force compensator, can be embedded into the shield emitters. This reduces the feedback, allowing more potent shields to be used. Unfortunately, this will draw power that would otherwise be used for re-energising the shields."
 tech_physics_interphased_105:0 "Grade Defletora Interfásica"
 tech_physics_interphased_105_desc:0 "In a multiphasic shield the different phases and modulations of gravitons coexist in a single layer. An interphasic shield takes this concept even further, allowing them to reinforce each other. This provides a stronger, more cohesive shield matrix. Due to the enhanced cohesion recharging the shield becomes less efficient, reducing the recharge rate."
 tech_physics_field_manipulation_208:0 "Chromodynamic Shielding"
 tech_physics_field_manipulation_208_desc:0 "Our scientists are making progress in understanding the concepts and relationships that underpin all types of energy. Using the current theories, lab tests have shown that the range of radiation which each graviton phase modulation interacts with could potentially be expanded. Each interphased graviton modulation could therefore reinforce other, mathematically related, modulations even further."
 tech_physics_multiphasic_86:0 "Escudo Defletore Multifásico"
 tech_physics_multiphasic_86_desc:0 "Refinements in the implementation of multi-spectrum shielding have led to the more advanced multiphasic shields. By carefully modulating the phase of the gravitons emitted, the multiple layers of older designs have been compressed into a single layer. A single layer eliminates the inter-layer interference problem, providing an immediate boost in shield cohesion."
 tech_physics_field_manipulation_211:0 "Hyper-Phasic Shielding"
 tech_physics_field_manipulation_211_desc:0 "Taking the concept of multiphasic shields further, initial research into hyper-phasic shielding has been conducted. A hyper-phasic shield uses quantum effects to squeeze gravitons closer together, allowing more to be added to a shield layer. This process requires both a large, continuous power supply, and a significant amount of extra computing power, in order to maintain the effect."
 tech_physics_field_manipulation_212:0 "Auto-Regenerative Shield Emitter"
 tech_physics_field_manipulation_212_desc:0 "There are many variables that can affect shield regeneration rates. Current shield management systems use case-based reasoning databases to manage emitter parameters. It would be more effective to make use of advances in computing, and equip each shield emitter with an autonomous management system, allowing it to better adapt to its precise environmental conditions."
 tech_physics_immersion_104:0 "Escudo Defletor Imersivo"
 tech_physics_immersion_104_desc:0 "Immersion Shields were originally developed to allow a craft to enter a high pressure environment but due to the constant strain on shield cohesion, having a highly energized shield isn't enough. These shields use a geometry that allows them to be recharged faster than the environment can damage them. However, they are less efficient at dissipating destructive levels of energy."
 tech_physics_field_manipulation_214:0 "Multi-Staged Immersion Shielding"
 tech_physics_field_manipulation_214_desc:0 "The shield geometry of immersion shielding was originally created for use in high pressure environments, not the vacuum of space. Having a series of variations of this geometry, each tailored for a different pressure range, allows the shield to be adjusted for the current circumstances. A set of suitable test sites for each pressure range will need to be located before geometry testing can begin."

 tech_physics_unimatrix_106_desc:0 "The Borg use incredibly advanced regenerative shielding. While we aren't close to replicating it, we can use sensor records of it in action to redesign our shield emitters. These new emitters allow us to preserve the rapid recharge rate of the older emitters while supporting a higher energy shield matrix."
 tech_physics_shield_88:0 "Conjunto Escudo Defletor"
 tech_physics_shield_88_desc:0 "In theory, an array of shield emitters is more effective at recharging a ship's shield than isolated emitters. In practice, the emitters create localised interference patterns that hinder their effectiveness. The continued refinement of graviton emitters will allow for more focused graviton emissions. At long last, shield emitter arrays are within our grasp."
 tech_physics_field_manipulation_218:0 "Nano-Shield Capacitors"
 tech_physics_field_manipulation_218_desc:0 "The miniaturisation of ultra-high discharge rate shield capacitors has reached the nanoscale which can be embedded in the hull material. Capacitor material availability, and the time required to embed it in a host material, serve to limit the amount that can be installed per starship. Despite this, a significant gain in combat shield regeneration rates is expected."
 tech_engineering_spaceport_564:0 "Starbase Central Shield Generator"
 tech_engineering_spaceport_564_desc:0 "Our continued advances in deflector shield technology, has led us with a way, to expand upon our previous designs, that were solely meant for spaceships.

 tech_thrusters_1:0 "Micro-fusion Thrusters"
 tech_thrusters_1_desc:0 "Nuclear fusion is the process of combining atoms to create larger atoms. When this occurs, energy is released. Thus, nuclear fusion reactors create incredibly hot plasma. This plasma has many uses. One such use is to expel it from a spacecraft, providing significantly more thrust than a chemical burn thruster. Miniaturising these thrusters allows them to be used in missiles and torpedoes."
 tech_specialization_thruster:0 "Breakthrough in Propulsion Design"
 tech_specialization_thruster_desc:0 "Despite the importance of a starships propulsion system, they have often received relatively little attention. Most improvements are simply iterations of existing designs. However, general advances in technology and a starships technical capability, mean that engineers are now developing prototypes of advanced engines. We will have to examine our needs and chose a complimentary design."
 tech_engineering_impulse_631:0 "High-Gain Impulse Thruster"
 tech_engineering_impulse_631_desc:0 "Impulse thrusters vent high energy plasma to provide thrust. There are two main distinctions between them and fusion thrusters. Impulse thrusters can use plasma from a warp core in addition to a fusion reactor, and they generally use a more complex exhaust manifold to greatly increase their efficiency. By further developing this technology, we can achieve even greater sublight speeds."
 tech_engineering_low_632:0 "Low Temperature Thruster"
 tech_engineering_low_632_desc:0 "Low temperature thrusters have a lower top speed, but make up for it with a smaller sensor footprint. This is useful during combat were tracking a fast, evasive starship, which is equipped with a variety of countermeasures, can be difficult. When these thrusters fire, it takes marginally longer for a hostile ship to isolate their signature, increasing the chance that an evasive move will succeed."
 tech_engineering_materials_1491:0 "Anti-Gravity Assisted Impulse Drive"
 tech_engineering_materials_1491_desc:0 "Current generation impulse drives use as much of the high energy plasma as they can. We will need to think of a different approach to increase our starships speeds. One possible solution is to create an anti-gravity wake behind the ship, repelling it in the direction of travel. This application of graviton technology has not been attempted before, doubtlessly there will be hurdles to overcome."
 tech_engineering_avidyne_633:0 "Avidyne Impulse"

 tech_engineering_improved_635:0 "Conduíte de Impulso Avançado"
 tech_engineering_improved_635_desc:0 "Avidyne impulse drives have suffered from handling problems, often being described as twitchy or jumpy. This problem has been traced to incompatibilities between the pulsed plasma exhaust, and the exhaust manifold geometry. This manifold design was restricted by the materials available. As new materials have been developed, it might now be possible to design a compatible manifold geometry."
 tech_engineering_materials_1494:0 "Shange Shunt Interface"
 tech_engineering_materials_1494_desc:0 "Engineers widely agree that modern warp cores can supply enough high energy plasma to meet our impulse engines demands, without requiring fusion reactors. Many engineering challenges must be overcome to facilitate this change. For example, new plasma shunts will be required to balance the load between the thruster array exhaust ports, without causing instability in the plasma flow characteristics."
 tech_engineering_materials_1495:0 "Compound Impulse Assembly"
 tech_engineering_materials_1495_desc:0 "The success of Shange shunt interfaces has opened new opportunities for impulse manifold designers. Ideas for a multi-vector thruster manifold have been drawn up, but current impulse assemblies can not support the design. We will need to create a new assembly, likely building it from miniaturised assembly segments, to form a flexible, compound impulse assembly."
 tech_engineering_hyper-impulse_637:0 "Hyper-Impulse Engine"
 tech_engineering_hyper-impulse_637_desc:0 "Taking the concept of warp reactor driven impulse engines to its logical conclusion, means having dedicated matter-antimatter reactors powering the impulse engines.

There are significant engineering challenges between now, and a working prototype fitted into a starship."
 tech_engineering_materials_1501:0 "Sub-Impulse Paralithium Thruster"
 tech_engineering_materials_1501_desc:0 "Paralithium synthesis technology has long been on the watchlist of Avidyne Stealth R&D Yards. Experimental paralithium engines have been shown to produce relatively cold, highly ionised plasma. Hopefully, this can be combined with ion engine technology to create a potent cold thruster. A new paralithium synthesis technique, yielding two orders of magnitude more fuel, will allow research to resume."
 tech_engineering_low_634:0 "Low Temperature RCS Thruster"
 tech_engineering_low_634_desc:0 "Reaction control system thrusters are vital for manoeuvring in space. They are responsible for fine translational and rotational adjustments. Unfortunately, the size of the RCS thruster ports have necessitated using high temperature exhaust to provide adequate force. This is changing, as next generation impulse reactors can route colder plasma to the RCS, at a high enough pressure to be useful."
 tech_engineering_low_636:0 "Cooled Impulse Capacitance Cell"
 tech_engineering_low_636_desc:0 "Impulse capacitance cells have been available for some time, but must keep the plasma hot to prevent de-energisation. If plasma scrubbing technology was to be advanced to the point that 98% of oppositely charged particles were filtered prior to storage, we could store the plasma cold. This would make it suitable for incorporating into our stealth impulse technology."
 tech_engineering_masked_638:0 "Masked Quaratum Thruster Array"
 tech_engineering_masked_638_desc:0 "Arrays of small, multi-vectored exhaust ports are being developed. If designed correctly, a thruster array will have an easier to mask electro-thermal signature, while greatly improving manoeuvrability. The engines reactors are also being retooled to use a newly certified fuel, quaratum. It has similar operating characteristics to paralithium, but with higher pressure output, increasing thrust."
 tech_engineering_materials_1505:0 "Paragravitic Drive"
 tech_engineering_materials_1505_desc:0 "Anti-gravity assisted impulse technology was conceived near the start of our cold impulse engine program. It was quickly dismissed and forgotten due to concerns over the detectability of gravimetric distortions, and our technical ability to control them. Recently, a team of researchers revisited the idea using modern graviton technology, and created a proof-of-concept stealth paragravitic drive."
 tech_engineering_materials_1506:0 "Subspace-Shifted Thruster Array"
 tech_engineering_materials_1506_desc:0 "A long forgotten experiment in multispatial sensor technology might prove to be revolutionary for stealth thrusters. It was found that graviton fields can be made to push active sensor beams into subspace. If this can be adapted for pushing thruster plasma exhaust into subspace, the sensor signature of our ships will drop dramatically. We might even be able to begin using hot plasma exhaust."
 tech_engineering_ullage_640:0 "Ullage Gronerium Afterburner"
 tech_engineering_ullage_640_desc:0 "Although more advanced propulsion systems are now the standard, older style chemical thrusters have a range of uses. The latest high performance fuel to be synthesised is a liquid called Gronerium. Before we can begin using this fuel, we must design a modern liquid fuel storage system, overcoming the reliability problems inherent to using liquid fuelled thrusters in low gravity environments."

 tech_engineering_inertial_641_desc:0 "Inertial dampeners absorb the inertial force generated by impulse and warp drive acceleration. It is theoretically possible to use the dampeners in reverse and provide limited acceleration. Current inertial dampeners don't have the capability to do so, as it would increase their size and power consumption. By designing new dampeners we can equip starships with them if required."
 tech_engineering_materials_1500:0 "FIB-3 Afterburner"
 tech_engineering_materials_1500_desc:0 "Although fusion reactors are becoming obsolete in primary impulse drives, they still have a place in secondary propulsion. The Fusion Intermix Booster project is attempting to use a fusion reactor to create thrust plasma, but then mix it with a small amount of antimatter to increase its temperature to 43keV. Heat and pressure stress induced structural integrity failures are still causing problems."
 tech_borg_thruster:0 "Omni-Directional Impulse"
 tech_borg_thruster_desc:0 "Our vessels hull designs are based on simple geometric shapes. They have multiple axis of symmetry, no real front or back. It would be inefficient to limit ourselves to a single direction of motion as most species do, we are capable of more. Thrusters exhaust ports can be mounted on each hull surface and feed by a decentralised network of impulse plasma generator nodes."
 tech_engineering_materials_1523:0 "Omni-Directional Impulse Array"
 tech_engineering_materials_1523_desc:0 "Omni-directional thrusters are versatile, however their distributed nature weakens their overall effectiveness.  Several technical enhancements are being investigated, such as avidyne reactors, but these might not be ready for an unacceptable amount of time. If a short term solution is required, we can find a way of enlarging the existing system. It will be inefficient, but functional."
 tech_engineering_materials_1524:0 "Omni-Directional High-Gain Impulse Array"
 tech_engineering_materials_1524_desc:0 "Thruster arrays have given a moderate power increase at the cost of efficiency, but further improvements are required. As avidyne engines are not yet ready, those improvements will have to be made to the current system. A portion of the current system inefficiency has been traced to the exhaust outlets; their design doesn't effectively limit plasma from dispersing along transverse trajectories."
 tech_engineering_materials_1525:0 "Omni-Directional Avidyne Impulse Array"
 tech_engineering_materials_1525_desc:0 "Since assimilating species 91 and becoming aware of the substance known as avidyne, we have pursued it for use as an impulse drive reactant. We have finally developed a way of storing this potent, but unstable, chemical for long periods of time. The final obstacle is to miniaturise avidyne synthesis nodes to the point that a sufficient quantity of them can installed on our vessels."
 tech_engineering_materials_1526:0 "Omni-Directional Impulse Manifold Array"
 tech_engineering_materials_1526_desc:0 "The old high-gain thrusters were adapted for avidyne plasma exhaust, but are not functioning as efficiently as simulations predicted. We currently lack sufficient data to fully diagnose the problem, but it is likely that our understanding of heavy plasma flow dynamics is flawed. Additional research will correct our understanding and allow us to design a more efficient thruster manifold array."
 tech_engineering_materials_1527:0 "Directional Paragravitic Impulse Array"
 tech_engineering_materials_1527_desc:0 "Through assimilation and experimentation, our knowledge of gravity manipulation techniques has advanced immensely.

Improved blast shields will channel more of the explosion towards the front of the torpedo. With our increased expertise in space borne sensors, scientists have devised an ECM suite that will make the torpedo harder to track and counteract."
 tech_engineering_rocketry_1688:0 "Perfected Spatial Torpedo"
 tech_engineering_rocketry_1688_desc:0 "The final step into spatial explosive warheads, this torpedo uses a heavy antimatter reaction to create hull busting torpedoes. Shielding, however, is still an issue for spatial torpedoes with their effectiveness being extremely limited against them."
 tech_engineering_deep_655:0 "Deep Strike Advanced Torpedoes"
 tech_engineering_deep_655_desc:0 "A prototype extreme range, high yield torpedo. Designed for bombarding targets from a safe distance, moderate tracking capability was added to help reduce the inaccuracy inherent to projectiles travelling large distances. Due to our engineers inexperience with this type of weapon, photon launchers adapted to fire 'Deep Strike' torpedos will suffer long reload times."
 tech_early_photonic:0 "Early Photonic Torpedo"
 tech_early_photonic_desc:0 "Early photonic torpedoes are the next step in antimatter warhead torpedo designs. They feature a more potent warhead than spatial torpedoes, and launch speeds can be increased due to lower mass requirements."
 tech_engineering_anti-matter_652:0 "Anti-Matter Weaponry"
 tech_engineering_anti-matter_652_desc:0 "Warp cores, a common reactor for powering starships and their warp drives, use a controlled matter/antimatter reaction to generate energy. This means that anti-matter creation, storage and manipulation technologies and infrastructure are already well established. They can be easily weaponized, leading to a new breed of variable yield, high potential warheads."
 tech_engineering_photon_653:0 "Photon Torpedo"
 tech_engineering_photon_653_desc:0 "Continued work on creating specialised components has drastically cut the power requirement and freed up a lot of internal space. Two things can now be done with the design; the space can be used to fit a significantly larger warhead and higher capacity energy reserve, or we can design a smaller case with a high mobility thruster system to create a shorter range homing torpedo."
 tech_engineering_rocketry_1618:0 "Type-4 Photon Torpedo"
 tech_engineering_rocketry_1618_desc:0 "Following the certification of the initial design, there was a desire to explore the potential of this weapon class. Several research labs were instructed to pursue independent branches of photorp design. Now that the program has produced several torpedo variations, it is felt that the time has come to take the most useful parts from each and unify them into a single generalised weapon."
 tech_engineering_rocketry_1619:0 "Type-6 Photon Torpedo"
 tech_engineering_rocketry_1619_desc:0 "New antimatter containment technology might allow an interlacing pattern of EM bubbles to be formed, each bubble containing either matter or antimatter. Warhead detonation is achieved by shutting down the EM field, removing the separation between the reactants."
 tech_engineering_type-8_668:0 "Type-8 Photon Torpedo"
 tech_engineering_type-8_668_desc:0 "High strength, low density materials have made some promising advances recently. We should assign a torpedo research team to investigate their suitability for use in torpedo casings. Hopefully a stronger, lighter case can developed, allowing the warhead to be enlarged and the launch velocity increased."
 tech_specialization_torpedo:0 "Advanced Photon Warhead Technology"
 tech_specialization_torpedo_desc:0 "Upgrades to manifold technology and launch technology have granted us two avenues to go down. Which should we specialise in?"
 tech_engineering_rapid_657:0 "Type-10 Rapid Fire Photon Torpedo"
 tech_engineering_rapid_657_desc:0 "Photon torpedoes can be developed according to two philosophies: 'hit harder' or 'hit more often'. By adopting the 'hit more often' philosophy we can develop launchers capable of rapidly firing light torpedoes. These torpedoes will have reduced destructive power and range compared to current designs, but have increased accuracy and tracking capability."
 tech_engineering_high-yield_656:0 "Type-10 High-Yield Photon Torpedo"
 tech_engineering_high-yield_656_desc:0 "Photon torpedoes can be developed according to two philosophies: 'hit harder' or 'hit more often'. By adopting the 'hit harder' philosophy we can develop torpedo launchers capable of firing heavier torpedoes with increased range. These will take more power to operate and have a much slower fire rate than standard torpedoes. Their size will also reduce their accuracy and tracking capability."
 tech_engineering_improved_678:0 "Type-12 Improved Rapid Fire Photon Torpedo"
 tech_engineering_improved_678_desc:0 "Greater availability of warp plasma rated composite materials means they can be used in the construction of photon torpedo cases and their launchers, providing two advantages. The launchers can recharge faster and a small amount of warp plasma can be mixed into the gas propellant, increasing its expansion rate. These launchers can fire higher yield light torpedoes without sacrificing velocity."
 tech_engineering_dynamic_679:0 "Type-12 Dynamic Variable-Yield Photon Warhead"
 tech_engineering_dynamic_679_desc:0 "Advances in multiphasic technology have lead to prototype multiphasic warheads. Instead of using EM bubbles, the matter is phased so that it can occupy the same space as the antimatter, without actually touching. To detonate, they are brought back into phase allowing a larger payload in a small package"
 tech_fusion_torpedo:0 "Fusion Warhead"
 tech_fusion_torpedo_desc:0 "Nuclear fusion is a reaction in which two or more atomic nuclei come close enough to form one or more different atomic nuclei and subatomic particles with the difference in mass between the reactants and products manifesting as the release of large amounts of energy, ideal for warheads for our vessels."
 tech_engineering_global_650:0 "Advanced Thermonuclear Warfare"
 tech_engineering_global_650_desc:0 "The basics of intersystem warfare at vast speeds require new tracking technology, and larger yields. Loading space missiles with fusion warheads far beyond what would be used on a planetary scale enables our forces to have a weapon capable to hurting the enemy."
 tech_engineering_rocketry_1638:0 "Fusion Missile Battery"
 tech_engineering_rocketry_1638_desc:0 "These space missiles are armed with fusion warheads which deliver a nuclear payload to their targets. Loading them in batteries allows for volleys of these missiles to be fired simultaneously."

 tech_engineering_kaon_686:0 "Kaon Torpedo"
 tech_engineering_kaon_686_desc:0 "Kaon particles are formed when atomic nuclei collide with other highly charged subatomic particles. They have no electric charge and have about half the mass of a proton. This energy release gives the torpedo its destructive power."
 tech_engineering_plasma_682:0 "Plasma Torpedo"
 tech_engineering_plasma_682_desc:0 "These torpedoes utilise warp plasma in their warheads. The plasma is extremely difficult to contain in such a small space frame however, which leads to rapid decay of the torpedo casing once the weapon is fired. Due to this fact, plasma torpedoes have virtually zero tracking capability, extremely short ranges, and consume significant amounts of ship energy stores to utilise."
 tech_engineering_rocketry_1690:0 "Sheathed Plasma Torpedo"
 tech_engineering_rocketry_1690_desc:0 "An antimatter sheath around the plasma torpedo can allow the torpedo to maintain stability and cohesion for longer than previously recorded, which results in an increased payload delivered to the target."
 tech_specialization_plasma_torp:0 "Advanced Plasma Explosive Weaponry"
 tech_specialization_plasma_torp_desc:0 "With some of the difficulties of containing plasma now resolved, new technologies are emerging which can take our plasma based explosives down certain paths. We can aim for a raw increased damage output, or improving its effectiveness against shields."
 tech_engineering_phased_691:0 "Phased Plasma Torpedo"
 tech_engineering_phased_691_desc:0 "These torpedoes utilise a phase inverter to alter the state of the torpedoes shielding to match that of the target. Theoretically speaking, this should allow the torpedoes increased shield penetrating efficiency."
 tech_engineering_enriched_692:0 "Enriched Plasma Torpedo"
 tech_engineering_enriched_692_desc:0 "With increase torpedo case and containment shielding we can now increase the plasma yield of our torpedoes, thereby increasing the damage output of our torpedoes."
 tech_engineering_charged_689:0 "Charged Plasma Torpedo"
 tech_engineering_charged_689_desc:0 "The Charged Plasma Torpedo loads a somewhat higher payload of warp plasma, but requires more energy to contain the plasma while the torpedoes are in their tubes."
 tech_engineering_rocketry_1645:0 "Polarity-Charged Plasma Torpedo"
 tech_engineering_rocketry_1645_desc:0 "The polarity charged Plasma Torpedo loads a higher payload of warp plasma, but requires more energy to contain the plasma while the torpedoes are in their tubes."
 tech_engineering_interphased_693:0 "InterPhased Plasma Torpedo"
 tech_engineering_interphased_693_desc:0 "By combining a cloaking device and a molecular phase inverter, the molecular structure of these torpedoes are altered upon launch so as to be able to pass through energy and even matter. There's no stopping these babies."
 tech_engineering_rocketry_1647:0 "Multi-Phased Plasma Torpedo"
 tech_engineering_rocketry_1647_desc:0 "Expanding upon previous iterations of phased torpedo technology, the warhead and the catalyst onboard these torpedos can be kept in separate phased instances, only combining once detonation is required. As both warhead and catalyst share the same space but in different phases the resulting explosion can be increased by an order of magnitude."
 tech_engineering_radon_690:0 "Radon Plasma Warhead"
 tech_engineering_radon_690_desc:0 "These torpedoes utilise Radon plasma instead of Noble Gas plasma. It offers a slightly greater yield without losing the slow degradation of the containment field. Thus the benefit of a small window for tracking is maintained."
 tech_engineering_noble_688:0 "Noble Gas Plasma Torpedo"
 tech_engineering_noble_688_desc:0 "Noble gas provides a somewhat less volatile plasma than warp plasma, leading to a slightly longer housing period before the plasma erodes the containment shielding and torpedo casing. This means that we will have a slight window of opportunity for tracking capability."
 tech_engineering_warp_694:0 "Warp Plasma Torpedo"
 tech_engineering_warp_694_desc:0 "Warp Plasma Torpedoes utilise warp drive plasma as the weapon's armament, requiring vast amounts of ships energy reserves to fire but causing significant shield and hull damage. The weapons range is severely limited however, which means that it is only effective at close quarters combat."
 tech_engineering_rocketry_1651:0 "Static Warp Plasma Torpedo"
 tech_engineering_rocketry_1651_desc:0 "Containing the warp plasma torpedo in a static warp shell decreases the rate of cohesion lost over time thus allowing for a much more effective warp plasma torpedo."
