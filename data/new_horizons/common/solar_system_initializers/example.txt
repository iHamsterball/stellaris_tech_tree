# This is a full example of system initializers and initializer trees
# A system initializer is used to initialize each solar system in the game by creating planets, setting names and values on everything.
# The system also has a tree structure that allows one initializer decide how neighboring systems should be initialized ( see the 'neighbor_system' part further down ).
#
# All numeric values can be scripted as 'x = 10' or 'x = { min = 5 max = 15 }', except within the triggers and effects
#
# Useful console commands:
# 'Draw.Clusters' will toggle clusters on/off. Some clusters are created in the beginning and will be used for placing empires. Clusters can(will) also be created from effects and events
# 'Draw.SystemInit' will print the initializer used for each system, as well as lines to show which initializer triggered another
