###
# In the description part of an event, you can now fill in the following lists in stead of setting a text:
# mandatory
# themes
# blocked
# All of these are lists of tags. Mandatory is best used to hook on to a starting entry, which then branches off based on themes and blocked.
# Themes match with "relevant" above.
