# Added possible_pre_triggers to jobs
#
# pre_triggers are fast triggers that are tested before full triggers
# they are meant to be fast and quickly exclude pops from jobs
# they take the form of yes/no question, if an entry is not included it will be ignored.
# possible values:
# 	possible_pre_triggers = {
#		has_owner					# whether the pop planet has an owner
#		is_enslaved					# whether the pop is enslaved
#		is_being_purged				# whether the pop is being purged
#		is_being_assimilated		# whether the pop is being assimilated
#		has_planet					# whether the pop is on a planet or not
#		is_sapient					# whether the pop is sapient
#	}
#
# example:
#	possible_pre_triggers = {
#		has_owner = yes
#		is_enslaved = no
#		is_being_purged = no
#		is_being_assimilated = no
#	}
