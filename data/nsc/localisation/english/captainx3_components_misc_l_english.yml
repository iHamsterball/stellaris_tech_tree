 SHIP_AURA_SHIELDS: "Shield Enhancement Field"
 SHIP_AURA_FIRING: "Integrated Fleet Network"
 SHIP_AURA_DAMAGE: "Enhanced Targeting Field"

 SHIP_SENSOR_5: "EWAR Sensor Array"
 SHIP_SENSOR_5_DESC: "The EWAR (Early Warning And Reconnaissance) Sensor Array is a very powerful sensor combining the best of both worlds, giving superior range without sacrificing on frequencies or fidelity, allowing our ships to easily detect objects and energy with great accuracy even at extreme ranges. However due to the power necessary to maintain such detailed scans at such long distances, the EWAR Sensor can only be mounted on our largest Capital Ships."
 SHIP_SENSOR_6: "Multispectrum Sensors"
 SHIP_SENSOR_6_DESC: "Multispectrum sensors can scan multiple bands within the electromagnetic spectrum, giving it a much wider range of ability to detect objects and phenomena throughout space, even at closer distances, which also allows our ships to travel at greater sublight speeds with more assurance."
 SHIP_SENSOR_7: "Transdimensional Sensors"
 SHIP_SENSOR_7_DESC: "Transdimensional sensors offer the widest known range of scanning frequencies and bands, allowing our ships to get very precise scans in a large radius, and with this precision comes the ability to safely travel at even faster sublight speeds."
 STATION_SENSOR_5: "EWAR Sensor Array"
 STATION_SENSOR_5_DESC: "The EWAR (Early Warning And Reconnaissance) Sensor Array is a very powerful sensor combining the best of both worlds, giving superior range without sacrificing on frequencies or fidelity, allowing our orbitals to easily detect objects and energy with great accuracy even at extreme ranges. However due to the power necessary to maintain such detailed scans at such long distances, the EWAR Sensor can only be mounted on our largest Military Stations, and the Sensor Station specifically designed to house it."
 STATION_SENSOR_6: "Multispectrum Sensors"
