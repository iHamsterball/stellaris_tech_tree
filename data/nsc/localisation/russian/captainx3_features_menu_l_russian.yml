 NSC_features.1.name: "NSC Features Menu"
 NSC_features.1.desc: "The NSC Features Menu has two purposes: configure all your NSC Feature settings in one place and to act as an information/FAQ center.\n\nYou can configure all NSC Features here, like Playable Guardians, AI Challenge, and even spawn in systems as you like.\n\nThe bottom half of this menu consists of information guides to NSC, explaining how certain features work in NSC, as well as providing an FAQ for commonly asked questions, although the best resource is still the NSC Mod Website."
 
 NSC_features.2.name: "NSC Feature Options Moved"
 NSC_features.2.desc: "§RATTENTION! IMPORTANT INFORMATION!§!\n\nNew Ship Classes & More now has all Feature option choices moved to a new "menu" called the NSC Features Menu, which is accessed by a new button located in the top right corner of the government view (select your flag in the top left corner of your screen to pop it up). This menu now contains all important NSC feature options, and §Yyou should check it first thing every single new game§!.\n\nUnderstanding this, the Playable Guardians feature is §Gautomatically on§! for ALL players who have Leviathans DLC at the start of every game. If you wish to deactive Playable Guardians, please visit the NSC Feature Menu and simply press the "off" button.\n\n§RCritical!§! The Guardian System Spawn Choice options are also inside the NSC Features Menu, and if you do not go to the menu at the start of the game and choose which Guardians you want, §Ryou will never see a Guardian outside Enclaves in your game§!. Please visit the NSC System Spawn Control Center inside the NSC Features Menu to do this.\n\nApologizes for the vigorous use of colors, but the NSC dev team wants to make sure you understand this new changeover so you can enjoy NSC as you want to play it.

The universal options allow you to take all systems of a particular type (example: Guardian systems) and spawn them in at the same chance percentage, say 100%. The individual options allow you to take certain system types (again, example: Guardian systems) and choose the spawn percentage chance of each system individually, for instance, 100% chance for Ether Drake, 50% chance for Automated Dreadnought, and 0% chance for Hive Asteroids.\n\n§YNOTICE!§! This feature allows you to continuously add hostile systems to your game for your continued enjoyment, however, this can have some downsides if overused. First, some PCs may not handle the increase in systems as well as others, especially after many dozens more have been added. Secondly, these systems are randomly spawned off different systems, so many copies could end up grouped together, and if used too much, the galaxy may become overcrowded with many copies of systems, but it should be a while before you reach this point.\n\nPlease select a system type and if you want to choose the spawn chances universally or individually."

 NSC_features_1000.a.tooltip: "This user manual gives you an in-depth guide into what Playable Guardians is and how it operates, allowing you to use the feature to it's full potential."
 NSC_features.1000.name: "Playable Guardians Guide"
 NSC_features.1000.desc: "§RThe AI will not use this feature.§!\n\nAt the beginning of your campaign, after you hit "begin", you received a pop-up notice, informing you that all Playable Guardian controls have been moved to the NSC Features Menu. Because of this move, all players who have the Leviathans DLC will automatically have Playable Guardians on at the start of the campaign. If you do not wish to deal with Playable Guardians during your campaign, you must make sure the feature is turned off in the NSC Features Menu. It's a simple button push.\n\nAfter deciding if you want Playable Guardians or not, you will realize there are currently zero Guardian systems in your galaxy (except Enclaves that retain their original spawn values). In order for any to appear in your galaxy, you must go into the NSC Features Menu and spawn them in yourself. This is done in the §YNSC System Spawn Control Center§!. The first option will be the "Guardian Universal" options: if you want all Guardians to spawn in with a 25%, 50%, 75%, or 100% chance. The next option in this menu will be "Guardian Individual". This will lead you to a chain of messages that will ask you, individually, if you want a 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, or 100% spawn chance for each Guardian in alphabetical order. This allows you to, for example, choose 100% chance for the Ether Drake, 50% chance for the Automated Dreadnought, and 0% chance for the Hive Asteroids.\n\nThis sort of spawn control can be used throughout the game, meaning you can spawn in any Guardian system (outside of Enclaves) at any time with any spawn chance you want.\n\n§RIMPORTANT!!§! If you what to use Playable Guardians at all you must spawn in at least one Guardian so you can defeat it and claim it as a Playable Guardian. If you do not spawn in any Guardian systems, Playable Guardians will not work. Furthermore, there is a §Yreward for successfully defeating all Playable Guardians§! outside of the new pirate one."
 NSC_features.1001.desc: "Once all that is complete, you play the game as you normally would, until you find a Guardian. Almost all Guardians have to be killed in order to unlock their "playable" counterpart. There is one exception and one notice for this "rule;" The exception is the Technosphere is the only Guardian that can be acquired "peacefully"... by assisting it with it's calculations OR you can hack it with the appropriate special project (or you can simply destroy it as well to unlock it), and the notice is that in order to unlock the Enigmatic Fortress, you must §Ysuccessfully complete§! the vanilla Enigmatic Fortress event chain to unlock the Playable Guardian version.\n\nAfter killing (or helping/solving) the Guardian, you should receive a pop-up message about building/growing your own. At this point, if it's your first defeated Guardian, you will immediately get the option to receive it or "get another." If you choose to receive it, you will either immediately receive a special project in your situation log to "build/grow" it with your choice of FTL Drive, or if it happens to be the Automated Dreadnought, Ether Drake, or Wraith, you will have a second window appear offering you different color schemes for these Guardians, followed by the selection of a FTL Drive. Select the color/drive you desire, then you will receive your special project in the situation log."
 NSC_features.1002.desc: "If you choose "another" Guardian, whether or not you actually "have" another, you will be lead to the §YPlayable Guardian Repository§!. It "holds" all the Guardians you have defeated and have "earned" their Playable Guardian versions. If it's your first Guardian, only one will appear in the listing, as the options unlock only as you defeat the Guardians yourself. As you continue to find and defeat Guardians, the listing will grow, to a max of 8 Guardians (assuming you grab the Carrack Pirate Galleon - the Hive Asteroids are not a Playable Guardian). Select any of the Guardians listed to receive it as your next Playable Guardian.\n\nAlso inside the Playable Guardian Repository is an option that will be there no matter how many Playable Guardians you have earned; the postpone option. This option, like the choice to activate/deactivate Playable Guardians in the NSC Features Menu, is here for your choice and convenience. The postpone option allows you to hold off on making a choice on a Guardian for a time between 1 and 50 years. This can be used if you don't want the Guardian you just unlocked because you're seeking another, or perhaps you don't want to deal with a Playable Guardian at this time.\n\nOnce you have a Guardian and have researched its special project, it will appear around your current capital. Playable Guardians always spawn around your current Capital without exception. A day or two after it appears around your capital (due to the game coding catching up), you'll receive a notice that your Guardian has been built/grown and is ready for your commands. Your Guardian costs §Yno upkeep whatsoever§!, however it will cost you §Y50 naval capacity points§! to maintain, so bare this in mind when playing. Your Guardian will remain with you until it dies, at which point, you will receive a notice of its death/destruction and then have the Playable Guardian Repository pop back up for you to select your replacement Guardian from any you have defeated up until this point, or again, you can postpone/disable the feature at this time."
 NSC_features.1003.desc: "For balancing reasons as well as gameplay, I have coded this mod to allow only one Playable Guardian at while some stats may give the illusion that some are equal to their original counterparts, each Playable Guardian is at least somewhat weaker than their originals. Why? Well, if I were to give any half-skilled player a Guardian that powerful they could probably conquer half the galaxy with just that Guardian. For those of you worried it's not going to be powerful enough to be fun, don't worry, they are still more powerful than almost any ships I know of (the NSC Flagship & ISB Ragnarok I think are the only ships with comparable durability/power), and I continue to look for different means of improving them. For those of you using mods that increase the game's difficulty, like ISB Balance, unfortunately I cannot assume that everyone else has that level of difficulty. You choose to use the mod for the difficulty, and I'm sure you can adapt to it.\n\n§GWill I ever allow more than one Guardian? How come I can actually get more than one if this is true?§!\n\nFor the first question, probably not, at least normally. This is why I gave the console commands for those willing to cheat, which can be found on the NSC Mod Website. The coding making sure there is only one Guardian is built into the main coding of the mod. Even if I took the time to remove it, I would have to setup another system around giving the player more Guardians, including removing the "free upkeep" feature. For the second, I said you can only get one §YPlayable Guardian§!, as in, from §Ythis mod§!. At max, you can have 3 Guardians; a Playable Guardian from this mod, the Automated Dreadnought, & the Baby Drake. Of course, the latter two cannot be regained, unlike the Playable Guardians. For those of you who are looking for loopholes, §Ythere are some loopholes§!! I didn't close all the loopholes, so for the clever player who can find them, you can have (at least for a time) more than one Playable Guardian, however, the mod is coded to not let you back into the Playable Guardian Repository until you have ZERO Playable Guardians left."
 NSC_features.1004.desc: "This finally leads me into the new Guardian created for Playable Guardians, the Carrack Pirate Galleon. This one automatically spawns in regardless of Playable Guardian and Guardian System Spawn chance choice, because I personally view it as the "final boss" for the Pirate Culture in your game. You will not find the Carrack Pirate Galleon in your game at the start. In order to have it appear in your game, you have to find the "Pirate Home System" (where the vanilla Pirate Galleon is) and attack the fleets in that system. Unfortunately, due to oddities in Paradox's coding, it should be that you have to defeat all 3 fleets in order to unlock the Carrack Pirate Galleon, however, I was lucky to manage to get it setup as it is now, so please bare with it if it doesn't happen quite as it should. You will receive a pop-up message about a "new system" discovered thanks to some panicked pirates (this message will appear to all players regardless of who attacked first, or if you are in singleplayer or multiplayer). It will appear near the Pirate Home System, and you can go there to defeat the Carrack Pirate Galleon. Personally, I would suggest you have 3 transports and a general on standby... if you miss your window, you cannot have it!\n\nThe Pirate Carrack Galleon will automatically join you regardless of if you have a Playable Guardian currently active, and is the only "normal" exception to the one Playable Guardian rule, and this Guardian can also be replaced through the Playable Guardian Repository like any other Guardian, therefore, only the "original" Carrack Pirate Galleon is an exception."
 NSC_features.1005.desc: "§RMultiplayer Games Have Slightly Different Functionality§!\n\nMultiplayer games function slightly different than singleplayer games. At the beginning of the game, all players will receive the Playable Guardian flag and each player will have the opportunity to go into the NSC Features Menu and deactivate the flag if they don't want it. Now, in order to avoid coding errors and extra Guardian systems being spawned from multiple players, §Yone player will be chosen§! to decide the Guardian System Spawn Chances part. I strongly suggest coordinating with fellow players via voice-over or multiplayer chat on how to proceed. Unfortunately, Paradox has not given modders any means of identifying the host, so it could be §Yany player§!. If I ever get a means of identifying the host, I'll fix this, but there is nothing I can do about it right now. \n\n§G"If I have to defeat each Guardian myself to unlock it, how do all of us in multiplayer get the same Guardian if there is only one?"§!\n\nExcellent question, one I had to ponder while making this. Despite the fact you can now spawn multiple inside the NSC Feature Menu, I still wanted a safeguard. What happens is if anyone defeats a Guardian (this applies to singleplayer as well if the AI beats you to killing a Guardian), the game will automatically search for any human players who have Playable Guardians active who haven't defeated said Guardian, and if it finds anyone, the game will spawn in a new system for that Guardian. This means, if even two people in multiplayer have Playable Guardians active, both should get the opportunity to defeat it, even if one player defeats it 5 times or the AI gets the Guardian at least once. This also means that after your first system spawns at the beginning of the game, you don't have to worry about spawning in more than one Guardian system type at any given time until you just "want to have fun" with more systems.\n\nIf you have an error where the safeguard doesn't kick in or a Guardian system never appears, you can use the NSC System Spawn Control Center to fix this."
 NSC_features.1006.desc: "As I stated before, ALL players in multiplayer will receive the message about the newly discovered Pirate System to get to the Carrack Pirate Galleon, however, §Yonly one player can have the Carrack Pirate Galleon§!, assuming that one player can get it in time. I currently have no means of "transferring" the Pirate Galleon to another player if both players meet in battle, having them dual to see who can grab it first. I'm not sure if I will add such a feature, but it is a possibility.\n\nPlayable Guardians Standalone is meant to be balanced in the fact that it fixes many issues with vanilla Guardians and allows the player to enjoy them without making it super easy. There really isn't any way to perfectly balance this out without more control over Stellaris base combat (individual ship & weaponry targeting for instance), however, if anyone has suggestions on ways to make the Playable Guardians more balanced (against each other, normal Guardians, etc), I'm happy to listen, although I promise nothing.\n\nAs for adding/subtracting Playable Guardian features, I am open to any and all suggestions, but given maintaining this feature is already a task and I have put many hours of work into it, I will not add/remove features because someone thinks the feature should/shouldn't have something. If I find merit in the suggestion (add or remove), I will consider it, and I'm open to any constructive criticism as to how I can improve any Playable Guardian feature currently present.\n\n§YPlayers looking to have multiple Guardians via Cheating - Console Commands§!\n\nI will not list the console commands here for respect for players who do not wish to have such information, however, you can find console commands allowing you to have more than one Guardian, along with warnings and notes about having multiple Guardians, either on the NSC Mod Website in the "Other Mod Features" tab or on the Steam Workshop in the appropriate discussion thread in the Playable Guardian Standalone mod."

 NSC_features_1100.a.tooltip: "Explains what the AI Challenge feature is and how it works."
 NSC_features.1100.name: "AI Challenge Feature"
 NSC_features.1100.desc: "§GWhat is this "AI Challenge Feature" and why would I want it in my game?§!\n\nGood question. First know the AI Challenge Feature's level can be changed at any time without consequence. The AI Challenge Feature allows all normal AI empires inside your campaign to keep up with you in terms of military ship/station class technology, with the degree depending on the level of the AI Challenge Feature you select.\n\nThe levels for the AI Challenge are as follows: Benign, Simple, Traditional, Extreme, Legendary, & Ultimate, each providing more technology to all the regular AI empires based on what level you choose. For descriptions of what each level offers, please see the AI Challenge Control Center, but to be clear, the Benign level is basically the "off" option, giving no help. After that, every year the game will check the designated human player's technology level against a list of technologies that each level of the AI Challenge will provide the AI to "keep up" with the player, and if the player has that technology but the AI doesn't, ALL AI empires without this technology gets the tech. Finally, the AI will also be forced to update their designs, hopefully making sure they utilize the latest technology.\n\nTo clarify, if for example the designated human player has the Dreadnought Technology but the next closest AI empire only as Battleships, or even more empires only have up until the Light Carrier, turning on ANY level of the AI Challenge (since they all provide the AI will ship class techs), will automatically fill in ALL gaps in technology between the AI and the player, so all regular AI empires will have the Dreadnought tech, including the Carrier and any other "fill-in" techs required.\n\nYou can also turn the AI Challenge on/off as you wish, depending on if you just want the AI to catch up and not "keep up". If you find the AI is too far behind, you can activate one of the AI Challenge Levels just long enough to go past a new year, the AI catches up, and turn it off again.\n\nFor a better, more detailed description of this feature, please visit the NSC Website and the AI Challenge webpage."
 
 NSC_features.1200.a: "§GInformation:§! Mothball & Scrapyard Facility User Manual"
 NSC_features_1200.a.tooltip: "Explains the operations of the Mothball & Scrapyard Facility Spaceport Module."
 NSC_features.1200.name: "Mothball & Scrapyard Guide"
 NSC_features.1200.desc: "The Mothball & Scrapyard Facility is a new spaceport module that allows a player to §Gmothball§! a fleet. This deactivates the chosen fleet, and it remains in orbit above the planet until the player chooses to reactivate it.\n\nWhile mothballed, the fleet is not controllable in any sense, and the upkeep for all ships in the fleet is reduced to 0. This is useful for players who want to keep an emergency reserve force but don’t want to pay the upkeep costs while it is not being used.\n\nOnce the player chooses to reactivate a fleet, it will take some time to make the ships operational again, and will cost minerals to do so. The cost can vary widely, but will never be more than 70% of the original mineral cost of the fleet. The reactivation process takes one month to complete and requires two construction ships to be in the same planetary orbit as the fleet itself.\n\nTo make use of this feature, first build the Mothball & Scrapyard Facility at the Spaceport where you wish to stage your mothballed fleets. Then you can use Planetary Edicts to Mothball a fleet, Reactivate a fleet, or to scrap a Mothballed fleet. Pop up dialogs will give details on the entire process. §YBe sure that you read the information provided there, it is important§!."
 NSC_features.1201.desc: "§RThe Mothball Module Process & Info:§!\n\nBuild the module at a spaceport of your choosing. §YDo not§! use your homeworld or any planet you plan to build ships at – once the module is activated, all military ships in orbit will be automatically mothballed.\n\nOnce the module is built, move at least one fleet to the planet and open the Planet Edicts window. Choose §GActivate Mothball Module§! and read the popup.\n\nOnce activated, the fleet in orbit will be mothballed and uncontrollable. §YAny other military fleet that enters orbit of the planet while the module is activated will automatically be mothballed with no notice or warning.§!\n\nOnce you are ready to reactivate your fleets, open the Planet Edicts window and choose §GDeactivate Mothball Module.§! §YBe Careful: This step will reactivate ALL fleets currently in orbit of the planet.§!\n\nA Special Project will show up in your Situation Log. You must move two construction ships into orbit to begin the reactivation process, which takes one month to complete.\n\nOnce complete, you will receive a bill for the reactivation cost. This cost starts at 10 minerals per 1 point of fleet capacity, and increases every 10 years up to a maximum of 50 minerals per 1 fleet capacity. (For example; If you mothball a fleet with 100 fleet capacity for 10 years or less, the reactivation cost will be around 1000 minerals. If the same fleet remains mothballed for 50 years, the cost will be roughly 5000 minerals.)\n\nIf you cannot afford to pay the entire reactivation bill up front, you will be required to pay monthly payments, based off of your empire’s total income, until the balance is paid in full."
 NSC_features.1202.desc: "§RMothball & Scrapyard Facility Special Notes:§!\n\nThe Mothball process applies to military ships only. It does not affect science, construction, transport, or civilian ships.\n\nWhile mothballed, ships are simply lifeless husks sitting in space and are not controllable in any way. Enemy ships will not see mothballed fleets as a target. §RIf the planet is ever bombarded, all mothballed fleets are destroyed.§!\n\nThe spaceport module also has the option of scrapping a mothballed fleet. This process works the same as mothballing, via a Planet Edict, and requires the same 30 day time period and two construction ships. The advantage to this is that you will be refunded some of the initial build cost of the mothballed ships."

 NSC_features.1300.name: "NSC Component Guide"
 NSC_features.1300.desc: "This feature is a result of the need for NSC Reactors for NSC Capital Ships. Everyone asked why we had this "oddly powered high tier" reactor with nothing else, or why our reactor was more powerful than the Enigmatic Power Core. So the NSC development team decided to make a "proper" reactor set, and then realized something else was needed to have the reactors reach full potential. Now you have the NSC Component Feature.\n\n§GWhat specifically is included in this NSC Component Feature?§!\n\n§YReactor Tiers 6-10, including an Optimized Enigmatic Power Core\n\nShield Tiers 6-10, including Optimized Psionic/Enigmatic Shielding\n\nArmor Tiers 6-10, including Optimized Dragon Armor\n\nSensor Tiers 5-7, with tier 7 being the EWARS Array\n\nEngines Tier 5, just to round it off§!\n\nThe option to "activate" these components will appear after you press "begin" at the start of your campaign. For those of you who use NSC without any "component" type mods, we highly recommend you accept them. For those of you who use popular "full" component mods, such as §RBunch of Ship Parts§! or §RExtra Ship Components§!, NSC will check to see if any of those mods are activate, and if they are, will tell you they are and then still give you the choice, although it's not recommended if you want a "clean" set of components.\n\nIf you accept the NSC components, this decision is §His permenent§! and cannot be done, however, declining the NSC components will still unlock NSC reactor levels 6 & 7, due to the power demand of NSC ship classes, and a new option will appear in the NSC Features Menu to receive the rest later if wanted.\n\nThe NSC Component Feature does not touch any vanilla files and is rather an extension of the vanilla sets, however, to make everything flow more uniformly, some vanilla icons were overwritten and certain component names/descriptions were altered.\n\n§RNOTICE!§! As of this current update, only §YExtra Ship Components§! and §YBunch of Ship Parts§! are currently setup to support this feature. §YCrystallis§! is a wait-and-see feature at this time."

It is an "upgrade" to the NSC Carrier class, giving the player new mid-sections giving 9 hangars each but lacking any other weaponry. This upgrade becomes available after you research the NSC Dreadnought ship class.\n\n§GWhy can't I find any other Ship Classes? Why is the Battlecruiser my highest level ship?§!\n\nFor the 6 spaceport levels, you will get one ship class per level in this order; Corvette, NSC Frigate, Destroyer, Cruiser, NSC Strike Cruiser, NSC Battlecruiser. After this, §Yyou must research each ship class individually in this exact order;§! NSC Light Carrier, Battleship, NSC Carrier, NSC Dreadnought, NSC Superdreadnought, NSC Flagship."
 NSC_features.2001.desc: "§GI cannot find the Science/Construction Cruisers. Where are they?§!\n\nIn NSC 6.0 and earlier, the Science/Construction Cruisers were difficult for some to find because no design was automatically generated and the Cruisers were a "second listing" of "Science/Construction Ship" in the New Design list. However, as of NSC 7.0, the Science/Construction Cruisers are no longer separate ship classes, but now "upgrades" to the vanilla ships as part of the "Enhanced Civilians Designs" upgrade tech found in the physics branch. For full details of this change, please find the tech or read about this on the NSC Mod Website.\n\n§GI built a new Mining/Power Station but my bonuses are the same. Why?§!\n\nParadox removed our best means of applying bonuses in the "Adams" update (Patch 1.6), so we had to find a new means of triggering the bonuses based on the number of stations. While not as efficient, the game checks every month after you build your first Power/Mining Station to see how many stations you currently have, and adjusts the given bonus to match. Therefore, after building/destroying a new Power/Mining Station, wait up to 30 days for your bonus to adjust.\n\n§GWhy do my ship designs have blank design names? Why do just the vanilla ships have design names?§!\n\nThis is the result of your chosen namelist not supporting NSC ship classes. Vanilla namelists include ship class namelists, but don't support NSC Ship Classes. When the namelist cannot find a given ship class, it goes to the "generic" name pool, however, most namelists now have a very small or non-existent generic name pool, resulting in NSC ship class designs either having repeating names or no name at all.\n\nTo fix this issue, you can either (1) find a modded namelist that supports NSC, (2) edit the namelist yourself to support NSC, or (3) download the template namelist provided by NSC in one of the discussion threads on the NSC workshop page and edit it further from there."
 
 NSC_features.2100.a: "§GInformation:§! New Ship Classes & More Bug FAQ"
 NSC_features_2100.a.tooltip: "This is a list of generally asked questions about NSC bugs that are normally encountered."
 NSC_features.2100.name: "NSC Bug FAQ"
 NSC_features.2100.desc: "§GI have this weird glitch no one else seems to have. I cannot play multiplayer with my friends because it says our NSC versions are different.§!\n\nThis has become a common issue with Steam and is the most common "bug" the NSC development team is asked to address. Problem is 98% of the time, these issues are not caused by NSC. They are caused by faulty Steam downloads of the NSC zip file. Therefore, we ask §Ybefore you submit any error reports for NSC§! that you follow these instructions below (also found in the NSC mod description under "Other Info") to "reset" your local NSC copy to hopefully refresh any corrupt download from Steam. If you still have the error after this, then report the bug to us. Thank you.\n\n§RHOW TO RESET NSC§!\n\nIf your copy of the mod is not working properly, delete this entire folder from your PC: Steam -> steamapps -> workshop -> content -> 281990 -> 683230077 (or 932869910 if you use Streamlined) and then unsubscribe and resubscribe to the mod. Verify that Steam is downloading the mod, and then try to run again. You may have to repeat this step a few times to get it working. This is becoming a common problem with Steam and we cannot fix it from our end.\n\n§GWhy does my error.log have all these weird errors in it? Do you guys ever check the error log? Will you clean it out?§!\n\nThe error.log is not as cut and dry as we would like. We do continue to check for "real" errors in the log and fix those, however, many errors in the error log are either Paradox's that we cannot fix, some we cannot quite explain (probably Paradox again), some errors that are errors but cause no harm to the game at all, and finally, errors that are there intentionally.\n\nNow before you exclaim "What! Why?" there are reasons for this. For a full description of "false/harmless/pointless" errors, please read the master FAQ on the NSC Website."
 NSC_features.2101.desc: "§GWhy is NSC out-of-date in the mod launcher? Are you going to update it?§!\n\nThere are only 3 reasons NSC should be out-to-date on your PC.\n\n1. You have a VERY old version that hasn't been properly updated by Steam in a long time (perhaps because you haven't played the game in a while), therefore you need to use the "reset NSC" method described on the previous page.\n\n2. You have subscribed to an available beta via Steam. NSC §Yonly supports the latest public version of Stellaris§!, therefore, any betas would say "out-of-date" because NSC is supporting the public version one number behind. Some betas are compatible with NSC, others are not. If you have a beta that doesn't work with NSC, please wait until it is released publicly.\n\n3. A new patch was just released publicly and the NSC development team is working to update NSC to function within the new patch. Please be patient as we determine what has been changed in the patch, as we get no more of a head start than any of you.\n\n§GI researched X ship class but there is no design in the ship designer.§!\n\nEvery now and again Stellaris will not produce an automatic design in the ship designer for an NSC ship class. The NSC Dreadnought seems to be its favorite to skip. To check to see if you did get the ship class after researching it's technology, look through the New Design listing in the ship designer. If it's there, you just happen to have no auto-designed preset, but if the ship class isn't there, something is wrong, and you need to try the "reset NSC" instructions on the previous page."
 NSC_features.2102.desc: "§GWhy does the ship designer say "shipdesigner_savefail_wrong_required_components?" What does this mean?§!\n\nThis happens when the auto-designer gives a ship class design either a component it shouldn't have access to yet or incorrectly sets a component that requires a mod that isn't active. We cannot fix this on our end as the auto-designer is part of the hard coding, however, we can tell you how to fix this error yourself.\n\nFirst thing is to look at the component section (the right side of the ship designer with the FTL, engines, sensors, etc). At the bottom is a component slot for Folk's Power Stations mod and it may not have been properly set with the needed "empty slot," whether or not you have Folk's Power Stations mod. There are also NSC Special Slot components that can be placed in auto-design that are still locked behind techs, thus they are invalid at the moment. Please check each of the component slots (again, right side of the designer, starting at the bottom) and make sure the option currently selected is available from all your options. If it isn't, replace it. Test again to see if you can save your design.\n\nIf you still cannot save your design, check the A-slots in the utility section (the bottom of the ship designer). Some NSC components go there that are locked behind techs you might not have yet, therefore, clear out your A-slots and refill them yourself then check to see if you can save.\n\nFinally, if something is still off, check any T-slots you have in weaponry (top of the designer), and specifically check for any Flak guns. These weapons are meant to only be placed on NSC Frigates, however, the auto-designer likes to use them even though it's ignoring restrictions."
