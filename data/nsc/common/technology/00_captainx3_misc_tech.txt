# TECHS IN THIS FILE #
######################

# TOTAL = 5
# Integrated Research Paradigm - Society - Starts R&D Center Building Chain.
# Reactor Tech Block - Society - This is used to "block" NSC Reactors level 8 and up from being given to the player IF they have BOSP, ESC, or Crystallis activated instead.
# Reactor Needed Block - Society - This is used to "block" NSC Reactors level 6-7 if there is another component mod active, otherwise is automatically given for NSC ship class power needs.
# Shield Tech Block - Society - This is used to "block" all NSC Shields from being given to the player IF they have BOSP, ESC, or Crystallis activated instead.
# Armor Tech Block - Society - This is used to "block" all NSC Armors from being given to the player IF they have BOSP, ESC, or Crystallis activated instead.
# Component Tech Block - Society - This is used to "block" all NSC base ship components (sensors/thrusters) from being given to the player IF they have BOSP, ESC, or Crystallis activated instead.
# AI Force Update - Engineering - This is used to force the AI to update all their global designs, so that new components will be properly added to the global designs... hopefully.
