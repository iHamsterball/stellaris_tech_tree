tech_ragnarok_eng_01_desc:0 "\nThe organic matter has been analysed and dated to be older than the age of our galaxy. Therefore, it must have extra-galactic origins. It is definitely artificial, but represents a branch of technology from a completely alien root that is far removed from our own, making understanding and replication difficult at best. Nonetheless, it warrants further research.\n\n"

tech_ragnarok_eng_02:0 "Organic Core"
tech_ragnarok_eng_02_desc:0 "\nThe organic matter we currently possess appears to be the basis for some sort of core - the central governing mass from which other structures will grow. Our scientists believe this core was originally part of a massive, spacefaring entity and which was destroyed eons ago. That the core matter survived and remained dormant but alive for so long is a testament to the resilience of organic technology.\n\n"
