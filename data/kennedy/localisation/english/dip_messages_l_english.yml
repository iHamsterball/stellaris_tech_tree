 04_HOSTILE_GREETING:0 "You have the attention of the [Root.GetName]. Speak quickly."
 05_HOSTILE_GREETING:0 "Why won't you just leave us alone, [From.GetSpeciesName]?"
 06_HOSTILE_GREETING:1 "You filthy [From.GetSpeciesNamePluralInsult] are a menace to galactic peace!"
 07_HOSTILE_GREETING:1 "Consider your words carefully, [From.GetSpeciesNameInsult]. Our military could crush your pitiful nation in one fell swoop."
 08_HOSTILE_GREETING:1 "Do not think that the [Root.GetName] will show you mercy because you [From.GetSpeciesNamePluralInsult] are too stupid to defend yourselves."
 09_HOSTILE_GREETING:1 "Infidel [From.GetSpeciesNameInsult], your uncouth [From.GetRandomSpeciesSound] is heard by the [Root.GetName]. What do you want?"
 10_HOSTILE_GREETING:0 "Your heathen philosophies of materialism have transformed your species into soulless machines, [From.GetSpeciesName]."
 11_HOSTILE_GREETING:0 "Your nation is both flawed and primitive, [From.GetSpeciesName]. It pains me to witness such inefficiency."

 16_HOSTILE_GREETING:0 "How lonely and selfish your citizens must be, [From.GetSpeciesName]. In your mad quest for individualism, your government has failed utterly to give them purpose."

 18_HOSTILE_GREETING:1 "We want nothing to do with your foul kind, [From.GetSpeciesNameInsult]. Why have you contacted the [Root.GetName]?"
 19_HOSTILE_GREETING:1 "What could a wretched space-[From.GetSpeciesNameInsult] possibly have to say that would interest the [Root.GetName]?"
 20_HOSTILE_GREETING:0 "You may call yourselves [From.GetSpeciesName], but your pitiful nation has clearly been corrupted by alien influences. What do you want?"

 24_HOSTILE_GREETING:0 "You have shamed our species in the eyes of aliens everywhere. Is it your goal to make [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] the pariahs of the galaxy?"
 25_HOSTILE_GREETING:0 "You may appear vaguely [From.GetSpeciesClass], but your low morals make me wonder if our xeno biologists are mistaken..."

 04_WAR_GREETING:0 "Do not think we will go easy on you because you are [From.GetSpeciesName]. Victory shall be ours!"
 05_WAR_GREETING:0 "You won't be able to threaten anyone else when we have finished dismantling your war machine."
 06_WAR_GREETING:0 "This conflict is exactly what our forces have been preparing for!"
 07_WAR_GREETING:0 "How can you hope to defeat us when the Spirits themselves are on our side?"
 08_WAR_GREETING:0 "We have developed many new weapons of war that need field testing. Thank you for this opportunity."

 03_OFFER_TRADE_DEAL_REFUSE:0 "Did you really think we would accept this offer? You don't think much of us, do you?"
 04_OFFER_TRADE_DEAL_REFUSE:0 "Do not waste our time with such an outrageous offer again."
 05_OFFER_TRADE_DEAL_REFUSE:0 "The [Root.GetName] firmly rejects this so-called "trade deal", if it can even be called as such."
 06_OFFER_TRADE_DEAL_REFUSE:0 "[Root.GetRulerTitle] [Root.GetRulerName] has reviewed your trade offer, and arrived at the conclusion that it would be utter madness for the [Root.GetName] to accept it."
 07_OFFER_TRADE_DEAL_REFUSE:0 "Is this appalling trade deal part of some sort of insane bargaining strategy you have devised? Do not bother us with such nonsense again."
 08_OFFER_TRADE_DEAL_REFUSE:0 "Perhaps you thought the [Root.GetName] would accept your outrageous trade offer without bothering to look at the details. We are sorry to disappoint you."
 
 01_CANCEL_TRADE_DEAL_PROPOSE:1 "Regrettably, the [Root.GetName] feels that the trade agreement between our nations is no longer in its best interests."
 02_CANCEL_TRADE_DEAL_PROPOSE:0 "[Root.GetRulerTitle] [Root.GetRulerName] has decided to terminate the trade agreement between our nations. We regret any inconvenience this may cause."
 03_CANCEL_TRADE_DEAL_PROPOSE:0 "Thank you for trading with us, but all good things must come to an end. We have decided to unilaterally withdraw from our trade agreement."
 04_CANCEL_TRADE_DEAL_PROPOSE:0 "The trade agreement we reached has served its purpose. The time has come to end it."
 01_CANCEL_TRADE_DEAL_ACCEPT:0 "Very well. We accept your decision, even if we do not understand it."
 02_CANCEL_TRADE_DEAL_ACCEPT:0 "While we think you are making a mistake, the [Root.GetName] accepts your decision."
 03_CANCEL_TRADE_DEAL_ACCEPT:0 "This was certainly... unexpected. Are you certain? Then so be it."
 04_CANCEL_TRADE_DEAL_ACCEPT:0 "As you wish. I will personally inform [Root.GetRulerTitle] [Root.GetRulerName] that our trade agreement with your nation has come to an end."
 
 01_EMBASSY_FRIENDLY:0 "Improved relations, you say? We are quite fond of you already, but why not?"
 02_EMBASSY_FRIENDLY:0 "You are already considered friends of the [Root.GetName], but we see no harm in improving relations further."
 03_EMBASSY_FRIENDLY:0 "Yes, friends. Let us further cement our relationship!"
 04_EMBASSY_FRIENDLY:0 "An excellent initiative. We should forge even stronger ties between our nations."
 01_EMBASSY_NEUTRAL:0 "Yes... improved relations with the [From.GetName] could suit our purposes."
 02_EMBASSY_NEUTRAL:0 "Improving the relations between our nations would certainly lessen the chance of future... misunderstandings."
 03_EMBASSY_NEUTRAL:0 "So you want a closer relationship with the [Root.GetName]?"
 04_EMBASSY_NEUTRAL:0 "We would have no objection to better relations between our nations."
 01_EMBASSY_HOSTILE:0 "Is this some kind of trick?"
 02_EMBASSY_HOSTILE:0 "You think our relationship can be salvaged?"
 03_EMBASSY_HOSTILE:0 "We see no reason to trust the [From.GetName]."
 04_EMBASSY_HOSTILE:0 "Is this initiative sincere, or are you mocking us?"
 01_EMBASSY_DISMISSIVE:0 "If you must, but do not expect much."
 02_EMBASSY_DISMISSIVE:0 "This is pointless."
 01_EMBASSY_PATRONIZING:0 "You wish our guidance, child?"
 02_EMBASSY_PATRONIZING:0 "We have much wisdom. We may be persuaded to share a small fraction of it."
 01_EMBASSY_ANGRY:0 "Do you think to placate us so easily, primitive?"
 02_EMBASSY_ANGRY:0 "Show proper obeisance, and we may deign to forgive you."
 01_EMBASSY_PROPOSE:1 "We aim to establish an embassy on [Root.GetHomeWorldName], for the future betterment of [From.GetAdj]-[Root.GetAdj] diplomacy."
 01_EMBASSY_ACCEPT_FRIENDLY:0 "We are deeply honored that you value the relations between our nations so highly."
 02_EMBASSY_ACCEPT_FRIENDLY:0 "This will surely benefit both of our nations."
 03_EMBASSY_ACCEPT_FRIENDLY:0 "You honor us. May our friendship last forever!"
 04_EMBASSY_ACCEPT_FRIENDLY:0 "As long as we stand together, nothing can threaten the [Root.GetName] and the [From.GetName]!"
 01_EMBASSY_ACCEPT_NEUTRAL:0 "Very well. Let us see where this will lead."
 02_EMBASSY_ACCEPT_NEUTRAL:0 "This will hopefully defuse any existing tensions between our nations."
 03_EMBASSY_ACCEPT_NEUTRAL:0 "[Root.GetRulerTitle] [Root.GetRulerName] welcomes this initiative."
 04_EMBASSY_ACCEPT_NEUTRAL:0 "That your government is willing to invest so much into fostering goodwill between our nations bodes well for the future."
 01_EMBASSY_ACCEPT_HOSTILE:0 "Perhaps it is not too late. We shall see."
 02_EMBASSY_ACCEPT_HOSTILE:0 "Let us see if this effort will prove enough to make us trust you."
 03_EMBASSY_ACCEPT_HOSTILE:0 "Hmph. We shall listen to what your diplomats have to say."
 04_EMBASSY_ACCEPT_HOSTILE:0 "This had better not be a trick."
 01_EMBASSY_ACCEPT_DISMISSIVE:0 "Your ambassadors will be monitored at all times, [From.GetSpeciesName]."
 02_EMBASSY_ACCEPT_DISMISSIVE:0 "Do not believe yourselves our allies. We do not ally with savages."
 01_EMBASSY_ACCEPT_PATRONIZING:0 "You are wise to seek the advice of your elders, [From.GetSpeciesName]."
 02_EMBASSY_ACCEPT_PATRONIZING:0 "Very well, child. We shall endeavor to guide you."
 01_EMBASSY_ACCEPT_ANGRY:0 "We do not forgive easily, [From.GetSpeciesName]."
 02_EMBASSY_ACCEPT_ANGRY:0 "This is likely a pointless endeavor. We shall see."

 01_RECALL_EMBASSY_FRIENDLY:0 "We trust our ties will remain as strong as ever."
 02_RECALL_EMBASSY_FRIENDLY:0 "Was it something we said?"
 03_RECALL_EMBASSY_FRIENDLY:0 "It saddens us to lose this valuable diplomatic channel."
 04_RECALL_EMBASSY_FRIENDLY:0 "Perhaps there is no longer a need for this particular type of diplomatic exchange."

 02_RECALL_EMBASSY_NEUTRAL:0 "[Root.GetRulerTitle] [Root.GetRulerName] supported this initiative of yours. Do not embarrass the [Root.GetRulerTitle]."
 03_RECALL_EMBASSY_NEUTRAL:0 "We have to wonder at your reasons, [From.GetSpeciesName]."
 04_RECALL_EMBASSY_NEUTRAL:0 "It would be unfortunate if our relations were to worsen as a result of this."

 02_RECALL_EMBASSY_HOSTILE:0 "This entire initiative is a fool's errand, [From.GetRulerTitle]."
 03_RECALL_EMBASSY_HOSTILE:0 "Good riddance."

 01_RECALL_EMBASSY_DISMISSIVE:0 "You're still here?"

 02_RECALL_EMBASSY_PATRONIZING:0 "You still need our guidance, child."
 01_RECALL_EMBASSY_ANGRY:0 "Your pointless meanderings do nothing to endear us to your cause."
 02_RECALL_EMBASSY_ANGRY:0 "Somehow, this would only make us angrier."

 01_RECALL_EMBASSY_PROPOSE:0 "We would rather terminate our ambassadorial program for the time being."

 01_RECALL_EMBASSY_ACCEPT_FRIENDLY:0 "Oh..."
 02_RECALL_EMBASSY_ACCEPT_FRIENDLY:0 "We hope to maintain our good relations, regardless."

 02_RECALL_EMBASSY_ACCEPT_NEUTRAL:0 "Perhaps it is for the best."
 03_RECALL_EMBASSY_ACCEPT_NEUTRAL:0 "Does this signal hostile intent from the [From.GetName]?"
 04_RECALL_EMBASSY_ACCEPT_NEUTRAL:0 "Hmm..."
 01_RECALL_EMBASSY_ACCEPT_HOSTILE:0 "We are glad to be rid of your deplorable influence."
 02_RECALL_EMBASSY_ACCEPT_HOSTILE:0 "We told you not to bother."
 03_RECALL_EMBASSY_ACCEPT_HOSTILE:0 "Actions speak louder than words, [From.GetSpeciesName]."
 04_RECALL_EMBASSY_ACCEPT_HOSTILE:0 "Another [From.GetSpeciesName] failure. It will not be the last."
 01_RECALL_EMBASSY_ACCEPT_DISMISSIVE:0 "How pointless that was."
 02_RECALL_EMBASSY_ACCEPT_DISMISSIVE:0 "Satisfied with your little experiment, [From.GetSpeciesName]?"
 01_RECALL_EMBASSY_ACCEPT_PATRONIZING:0 "You show your lack of wisdom yet again, [From.GetSpeciesName]."

 03_MAKE_RIVAL_NEUTRAL:0 "We did not believe the rumors of [From.GetSpeciesAdj] duplicity. Perhaps we should have."
 04_MAKE_RIVAL_NEUTRAL:0 "Two can play this game."
 01_MAKE_RIVAL_HOSTILE:0 "Your vapid insinuations will fall on deaf hearing-membranes, [From.GetSpeciesName]."

 01_MAKE_RIVAL_DISMISSIVE:0 "Rivals, you say. Who are you again?"
 02_MAKE_RIVAL_DISMISSIVE:0 "Tend to your own affairs, [From.GetSpeciesName]."
 01_MAKE_RIVAL_PATRONIZING:0 "You would seek to rival your betters?"
 02_MAKE_RIVAL_PATRONIZING:0 "Amusing."

 01_MAKE_RIVAL_ACCEPT_FRIENDLY:0 "I never knew [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] were so treacherous!"
 02_MAKE_RIVAL_ACCEPT_FRIENDLY:0 "This... this is unforgivable."
 03_MAKE_RIVAL_ACCEPT_FRIENDLY:0 "I thought we were friends!"

 04_MAKE_RIVAL_ACCEPT_NEUTRAL:0 "So be it."
 01_MAKE_RIVAL_ACCEPT_HOSTILE:0 "Your despicable little empire will crumble soon enough. We'll see to that."
 02_MAKE_RIVAL_ACCEPT_HOSTILE:0 "Is that a challenge? We accept!"
 03_MAKE_RIVAL_ACCEPT_HOSTILE:0 "Remember this moment when our fleets orbit [From.Capital.GetName]."
 04_MAKE_RIVAL_ACCEPT_HOSTILE:0 "There was never any point in reasoning with you anyway, [From.GetSpeciesName]."
 01_MAKE_RIVAL_ACCEPT_DISMISSIVE:0 "Do as you will. It matters little to the [Root.GetName]."
 02_MAKE_RIVAL_ACCEPT_DISMISSIVE:0 "Was that all?"
 01_MAKE_RIVAL_ACCEPT_PATRONIZING:0 "If you the [From.GetSpeciesName] do not wish to be called children, perhaps you should stop throwing tantrums?"
 02_MAKE_RIVAL_ACCEPT_PATRONIZING:0 "You would be wiser to pick fight with the other children, [From.GetSpeciesName]."
 01_MAKE_RIVAL_ACCEPT_ANGRY:0 "The [From.GetSpeciesAdj] brain is evidently still too primitive to fully comprehend the ramifications of its actions."

 04_END_RIVALRY_FRIENDLY:0 "First you stab us in the back, and now you want to make up?"
 01_END_RIVALRY_NEUTRAL:0 "This rivalry is pointless. Let it end."
 02_END_RIVALRY_NEUTRAL:0 "If you wish better relations with the [Root.GetName], you will have to work for it."
 03_END_RIVALRY_NEUTRAL:0 "Interesting..."
 04_END_RIVALRY_NEUTRAL:0 "You are far too changeable, [From.GetSpeciesName]."

 03_END_RIVALRY_HOSTILE:0 "I see [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] are every bit as cowardly as I was told."

 01_END_RIVALRY_PATRONIZING:0 "This is a wise course of action, child."
 02_END_RIVALRY_PATRONIZING:0 "Is the tantrum at an end, then?"
 01_END_RIVALRY_ANGRY:0 "Is there no end to your excruciating thoughtlessness, [From.GetSpeciesName]?"
 02_END_RIVALRY_ANGRY:0 "Beg for our forgiveness, primitive, and we MAY deign to grant it."
 01_END_RIVALRY_PROPOSE:0 "Will you not cease your mean-spirited campaigning?"
 01_END_RIVALRY_ACCEPT_FRIENDLY:0 "We will attempt to forgive you, as friends do."
 02_END_RIVALRY_ACCEPT_FRIENDLY:0 "We still don't understand why you considered us a rival in the first place..."
 03_END_RIVALRY_ACCEPT_FRIENDLY:0 "It will be hard to forget your betrayal. Even so, we're glad."
 04_END_RIVALRY_ACCEPT_FRIENDLY:0 "The [Root.GetName] recognizes this important first step on the road to restoring our relations."
 01_END_RIVALRY_ACCEPT_NEUTRAL:0 "Very well."
 02_END_RIVALRY_ACCEPT_NEUTRAL:0 "So be it."
 03_END_RIVALRY_ACCEPT_NEUTRAL:0 "An interesting opportunity for us both."
 04_END_RIVALRY_ACCEPT_NEUTRAL:0 "Good."
 01_END_RIVALRY_ACCEPT_HOSTILE:0 "Don't think this changes anything between us, [From.GetSpeciesName]."
 02_END_RIVALRY_ACCEPT_HOSTILE:0 "A futile gesture."
 03_END_RIVALRY_ACCEPT_HOSTILE:0 "Your begging is amusing, but we will still destroy you."
 04_END_RIVALRY_ACCEPT_HOSTILE:0 "How pitiful."
 01_END_RIVALRY_ACCEPT_DISMISSIVE:0 "Run along now, little [From.GetName]."
 02_END_RIVALRY_ACCEPT_DISMISSIVE:0 "This certainly was pointless."
 01_END_RIVALRY_ACCEPT_PATRONIZING:0 "It seems even children can show wisdom, at times."
 02_END_RIVALRY_ACCEPT_PATRONIZING:0 "Very good. We still have much to teach you."
 01_END_RIVALRY_ACCEPT_ANGRY:0 "Too little, too late."

 01_INTEGRATE_HOSTILE:0 "Is this a joke?"
 01_INTEGRATE_DISMISSIVE:0 "What ridiculous notion is this?"
 01_INTEGRATE_PATRONIZING:0 "Cute."
 01_INTEGRATE_ANGRY:0 "Your delusions of grandeur continue to test our patience, [From.GetSpeciesName]."
 01_INTEGRATE_PROPOSE:0 "Subsume your nation into our empire, [From.GetSpeciesName]."

 01_CANCEL_INTEGRATE_DISMISSIVE:0 "Begone, then."
 01_CANCEL_INTEGRATE_PATRONIZING:0 "Bit off more than you could chew, little one?"
 01_CANCEL_INTEGRATE_ANGRY:0 "Never trust a [From.GetSpeciesName] to do a sentient being's job."
 01_CANCEL_INTEGRATE_PROPOSE:0 "We will cease integrating your nation for now."

 01_CANCEL_INTEGRATE_ACCEPT_FRIENDLY:0 "Disappointing, to be sure."
 01_CANCEL_INTEGRATE_ACCEPT_NEUTRAL:0 "Perhaps it is not the right time."
 01_CANCEL_INTEGRATE_ACCEPT_HOSTILE:0 "Pathetic."

 06_INSULT_PROPOSE_XENOPHOBE:1 "Look at yourselves! What is that thing in your face, some kind of [Root.GetSpeciesMouthName]? Wait... is that even your face!? How can you not see that you [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] are an affront to nature?"
 07_INSULT_PROPOSE_XENOPHOBE:0 "Your so called [Root.GetName] is a nation of mutants, deviants and throwbacks... The fact that we have a common ancestry makes me sick!"
 01_INSULT_PROPOSE_PAC_MIL:0 "The ridiculous focus of the [Root.GetName] on all things military has us wondering if you're perhaps compensating for something."

 04_INSULT_PROPOSE_PAC_MIL:0 "The belligerence of the [Root.GetName] is matched only by its stupidity. Can't you see that you are slaves to militarism?"
 01_INSULT_PROPOSE_MIL_PAC:0 "The cowardice of the [Root.GetName] is widely discussed in the [From.GetName]. How is it that you became such a spineless nation?"
 02_INSULT_PROPOSE_MIL_PAC:0 "What makes a being turn pacifist? Lust for gold? Power? Or were you just born with a heart full of pacifism? It's enough to make you sick."
 03_INSULT_PROPOSE_MIL_PAC:0 "Those unwilling to defend themselves have no right to exist. We do not expect the [Root.GetName] to survive the decade."
 04_INSULT_PROPOSE_MIL_PAC:0 "What a meek and deplorable little nation the [Root.GetName] is. The [From.GetName] would have crushed you long ago if we thought you worth the effort."
 01_INSULT_PROPOSE_MAT_SPI:0 "Can you tell us more about that silly religion you're so fond of in the [Root.GetName]? We could use a good laugh!"
 02_INSULT_PROPOSE_MAT_SPI:0 "How any rational, thinking being could embrace spiritualism is beyond us. Why is it that you cling to such primitive beliefs?"
 03_INSULT_PROPOSE_MAT_SPI:0 "We have seen through your charade. The so-called 'spiritualism' your government has embraced is nothing more than a devious attempt to control the minds and hearts of your people."
 04_INSULT_PROPOSE_MAT_SPI:0 "Everyone else is laughing at your absurd spiritual beliefs. Are you really so blind in the [Root.GetName] that you can't see this?"
 01_INSULT_PROPOSE_SPI_MAT:0 "What a dull and soulless place your materialistic nation must be. Tell me, have you invented a sense of humor yet? No? A pity."
 02_INSULT_PROPOSE_SPI_MAT:0 "For a nation that has embraced science and materialism, the [Root.GetName] is remarkably primitive. Is it due to bad luck or are you just stupid?"
 03_INSULT_PROPOSE_SPI_MAT:0 "The [Root.GetName] is a nation designed for computers and automatons, not breathing organics. Are you even capable of feeling emotion?"
 04_INSULT_PROPOSE_SPI_MAT:0 "The [Root.GetName] is a failed experiment. Its only worth is as a lesson to the rest of the galaxy on the dangers of embracing the cold and lifeless philosophy of materialism."
 01_INSULT_PROPOSE_COL_IND:0 "Is the [Root.GetName] even a real nation or just an anarchic gaggle of quarreling individuals? You must forgive me, but your political system, such as it is, makes it hard to tell."
 02_INSULT_PROPOSE_COL_IND:0 "So who is it that rules your amusing little star nation today? What a quaint notion, to "vote" someone into power! It will inevitably lead to your collapse, of course."
 03_INSULT_PROPOSE_COL_IND:0 "Your democratic ideals are a blight on this galaxy, and so is the [Root.GetName]."
 04_INSULT_PROPOSE_COL_IND:0 "What a selfish people you are, always putting your individual selves foremost. Individualism... ha! The [Root.GetName] will not survive the year."
 01_INSULT_PROPOSE_IND_COL:0 "Your brutal, totalitarian regime will eventually fall, and there will be a reckoning."

 03_INSULT_PROPOSE_IND_COL:0 "How sad that a totalitarian nation such as the [Root.GetName] can exist. It is an embarrassment to sentient beings everywhere."
 04_INSULT_PROPOSE_IND_COL:0 "The cruel oppression of the people living under the yoke of the [Root.GetName] has to end one day. Your collectivism will prove your undoing."

 03_INSULT_PROPOSE_PHO_PHI:0 "The perverse interest in alien cultures that is prevalent throughout the [Root.GetName] is an affront to the universe!"
 04_INSULT_PROPOSE_PHO_PHI:0 "It has become clear to us that your willingness to embrace alien cultures in the [Root.GetName] is because you never fostered one of your own."
 01_INSULT_PROPOSE_PHI_PHO:0 "You poor, bigoted fools. Why are you so afraid of that which is different?"
 02_INSULT_PROPOSE_PHI_PHO:0 "Our patience with your prejudices against other cultures is wearing thin. When will you be civilized enough to truly join the interstellar community?"
 03_INSULT_PROPOSE_PHI_PHO:0 "Your intolerant society brings shame to the entire [Root.GetName]."

 01_INSULT_FRIENDLY:0 "Yes, friend? What was the important matter you wanted to discuss?"
