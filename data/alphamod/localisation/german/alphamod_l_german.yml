 alpha_observation.2.name: "The Prophet"
 alpha_observation.2.desc: "The observation station of §Y[Root.GetName]§! has submitted a lengthy report on how they have recently botched the examination and return of an abductee.\n\nApparently the subject was more conscious than first realised during the exam, and then an attempt to wipe certain memories failed. The subject was returned before either of these mistakes was identified!\n\nThe subject is now considered a Prophet by many on §Y[Root.GetName]§! and has already developed a large cult following. This movement counts many of the planet's leaders as devoted followers and the so-called Prophet is gaining influence and power day by day!\n\nThe station scientists have requested assistance with either exploiting or eliminating the Prophet. Or we could just do nothing and hope the problem resolves itself."
 alpha_observation.2.a: "We should exploit this Prophet!"

 alpha_observation.4.a: "Unacceptable!"
 alpha_observation.5.name: "The Prophet"
