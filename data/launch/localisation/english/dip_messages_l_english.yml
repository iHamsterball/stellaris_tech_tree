 03_HOSTILE_GREETING:0 "No more games, [From.GetSpeciesName]. What do you want?"
 04_HOSTILE_GREETING:0 "You have the attention of the [Root.GetName]. Speak quickly."
 05_HOSTILE_GREETING:0 "Why won't you just leave us alone, [From.GetSpeciesName]?"
 06_HOSTILE_GREETING:1 "You filthy [From.GetSpeciesNamePluralInsult] are a menace to galactic peace!"
 07_HOSTILE_GREETING:1 "Consider your words carefully, [From.GetSpeciesNameInsult]. Our military could crush your pitiful nation in one fell swoop."
 08_HOSTILE_GREETING:1 "Do not think that the [Root.GetName] will show you mercy because you [From.GetSpeciesNamePluralInsult] are too stupid to defend yourselves."
 09_HOSTILE_GREETING:1 "Infidel [From.GetSpeciesNameInsult], your uncouth [From.GetRandomSpeciesSound] is heard by the [Root.GetName]. What do you want?"
 10_HOSTILE_GREETING:0 "Your heathen philosophies of materialism have transformed your species into soulless machines, [From.GetSpeciesName]."
 11_HOSTILE_GREETING:0 "Your nation is both flawed and primitive, [From.GetSpeciesName]. It pains me to witness such inefficiency."
 12_HOSTILE_GREETING:0 "Ah, the [From.GetSpeciesName] zealots. If you have come to convert the [Root.GetName] to your despicable religion, I shall terminate communications."
 13_HOSTILE_GREETING:0 "[From.GetSpeciesName]. You should know that your people are not very popular among our citizens."

 18_HOSTILE_GREETING:1 "We want nothing to do with your foul kind, [From.GetSpeciesNameInsult]. Why have you contacted the [Root.GetName]?"

 24_HOSTILE_GREETING:0 "You have shamed our species in the eyes of aliens everywhere. Is it your goal to make [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] the pariahs of the galaxy?"
 25_HOSTILE_GREETING:0 "You may appear vaguely [From.GetSpeciesClass], but your low morals make me wonder if our xeno biologists are mistaken..."
 26_HOSTILE_GREETING:0 "You call yourselves [From.GetSpeciesClassPlural]... It makes me sick to the [Root.GetSpeciesOrganName]. Degenerates! You are but an unclean shadow of us true [Root.GetSpeciesClassPlural]."

 07_NEUTRAL_GREETING:0 "I speak for the [Root.GetName]. Be aware that our military is monitoring this channel."

 13_FRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "Our citizens have come to regard your people as friends, [From.GetSpeciesName]."
 14_FRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "While we prefer free societies, we cannot deny that your government does a good job of seeing to the needs of your citizens."

 17_FRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "For aliens, you [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] are surprisingly... agreeable. What can the [Root.GetName] do for you?"
 18_FRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "[From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] have been lauded by [Root.GetRulerTitle] [Root.GetRulerName] as a rare example of an alien species worthy of our respect. How can I be of assistance?"

 12_WAR_GREETING:0 "If war is the only way to unite all [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural], then so be it."
 13_WAR_GREETING:0 "[From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] will only reach their full potential as citizens of the [Root.GetName]."

 02_FALLEN_EMPIRE_PATRONIZING_GREETING:0 "Pleased to see that you are still around, [From.GetSpeciesName]! You would not believe how many species we have seen come and go over the years."

 04_MAKE_RIVAL_ACCEPT_FRIENDLY:0 "The [Root.GetSpeciesName] will not forget this betrayal."
 01_MAKE_RIVAL_ACCEPT_NEUTRAL:0 "We will not soon forget this, [From.GetSpeciesName]."
 02_MAKE_RIVAL_ACCEPT_NEUTRAL:0 "Do not be surprised if we respond in kind."
 03_MAKE_RIVAL_ACCEPT_NEUTRAL:0 "You've made a huge mistake, [From.GetSpeciesName]."
 04_MAKE_RIVAL_ACCEPT_NEUTRAL:0 "So be it."
 01_MAKE_RIVAL_ACCEPT_HOSTILE:0 "Your despicable little empire will crumble soon enough. We'll see to that."
 02_MAKE_RIVAL_ACCEPT_HOSTILE:0 "Is that a challenge? We accept!"
 03_MAKE_RIVAL_ACCEPT_HOSTILE:0 "Remember this moment when our fleets orbit [From.Capital.GetName]."
 04_MAKE_RIVAL_ACCEPT_HOSTILE:0 "There was never any point in reasoning with you anyway, [From.GetSpeciesName]."
 01_MAKE_RIVAL_ACCEPT_DISMISSIVE:0 "Do as you will. It matters little to the [Root.GetName]."
 02_MAKE_RIVAL_ACCEPT_DISMISSIVE:0 "Was that all?"
 01_MAKE_RIVAL_ACCEPT_PATRONIZING:0 "If you the [From.GetSpeciesName] do not wish to be called children, perhaps you should stop throwing tantrums?"
 02_MAKE_RIVAL_ACCEPT_PATRONIZING:0 "You would be wiser to pick fight with the other children, [From.GetSpeciesName]."
 01_MAKE_RIVAL_ACCEPT_ANGRY:0 "The [From.GetSpeciesAdj] brain is evidently still too primitive to fully comprehend the ramifications of its actions."
 02_MAKE_RIVAL_ACCEPT_ANGRY:0 "Your worlds will burn, savage."
 01_END_RIVALRY_FRIENDLY:0 "Has the [From.GetName] finally come to its senses?"
 02_END_RIVALRY_FRIENDLY:0 "So you've come to apologize, [From.GetRuleTitle]?"
 03_END_RIVALRY_FRIENDLY:0 "You wish to be friends again?"
 04_END_RIVALRY_FRIENDLY:0 "First you stab us in the back, and now you want to make up?"
 01_END_RIVALRY_NEUTRAL:0 "This rivalry is pointless. Let it end."
 02_END_RIVALRY_NEUTRAL:0 "If you wish better relations with the [Root.GetName], you will have to work for it."
 03_END_RIVALRY_NEUTRAL:0 "Interesting..."
 04_END_RIVALRY_NEUTRAL:0 "You are far too changeable, [From.GetSpeciesName]."
 01_END_RIVALRY_HOSTILE:0 "You are ridiculous."
 02_END_RIVALRY_HOSTILE:0 "Begging for mercy already, [From.GetSpeciesName]?"
 03_END_RIVALRY_HOSTILE:0 "I see [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] are every bit as cowardly as I was told."
 04_END_RIVALRY_HOSTILE:0 "We have no intention of forgiving the [From.GetName]."
 01_END_RIVALRY_DISMISSIVE:0 "... we're rivals?"
 02_END_RIVALRY_DISMISSIVE:0 "I'm sure this is very important to you, but not to us."
 01_END_RIVALRY_PATRONIZING:0 "This is a wise course of action, child."
 02_END_RIVALRY_PATRONIZING:0 "Is the tantrum at an end, then?"
 01_END_RIVALRY_ANGRY:0 "Is there no end to your excruciating thoughtlessness, [From.GetSpeciesName]?"
 02_END_RIVALRY_ANGRY:0 "Beg for our forgiveness, primitive, and we MAY deign to grant it."
 01_END_RIVALRY_PROPOSE:0 "Will you not cease your mean-spirited campaigning?"
 01_END_RIVALRY_ACCEPT_FRIENDLY:0 "We will attempt to forgive you, as friends do."
 02_END_RIVALRY_ACCEPT_FRIENDLY:0 "We still don't understand why you considered us a rival in the first place..."
 03_END_RIVALRY_ACCEPT_FRIENDLY:0 "It will be hard to forget your betrayal. Even so, we're glad."
 04_END_RIVALRY_ACCEPT_FRIENDLY:0 "The [Root.GetName] recognizes this important first step on the road to restoring our relations."
 01_END_RIVALRY_ACCEPT_NEUTRAL:0 "Very well."
 02_END_RIVALRY_ACCEPT_NEUTRAL:0 "So be it."
 03_END_RIVALRY_ACCEPT_NEUTRAL:0 "An interesting opportunity for us both."
 04_END_RIVALRY_ACCEPT_NEUTRAL:0 "Good."
 01_END_RIVALRY_ACCEPT_HOSTILE:0 "Don't think this changes anything between us, [From.GetSpeciesName]."
 02_END_RIVALRY_ACCEPT_HOSTILE:0 "A futile gesture."
 03_END_RIVALRY_ACCEPT_HOSTILE:0 "Your begging is amusing, but we will still destroy you."
 04_END_RIVALRY_ACCEPT_HOSTILE:0 "How pitiful."
 01_END_RIVALRY_ACCEPT_DISMISSIVE:0 "Run along now, little [From.GetName]."
 02_END_RIVALRY_ACCEPT_DISMISSIVE:0 "This certainly was pointless."
 01_END_RIVALRY_ACCEPT_PATRONIZING:0 "It seems even children can show wisdom, at times."
 02_END_RIVALRY_ACCEPT_PATRONIZING:0 "Very good. We still have much to teach you."
 01_END_RIVALRY_ACCEPT_ANGRY:0 "Too little, too late."
 02_END_RIVALRY_ACCEPT_ANGRY:0 "Your repentance means nothing to us, [From.GetSpeciesName]."

 01_INTEGRATE_FRIENDLY:0 "[From.GetRulerTitle] [From.GetRulerName] has proven to be a trustworthy confidant. The [Root.GetName] will consider a future as part of the [From.GetName]."
 01_INTEGRATE_NEUTRAL:0 "We will hear your proposal."
 01_INTEGRATE_HOSTILE:0 "Is this a joke?"
 01_INTEGRATE_DISMISSIVE:0 "What ridiculous notion is this?"
 01_INTEGRATE_PATRONIZING:0 "Cute."
 01_INTEGRATE_ANGRY:0 "Your delusions of grandeur continue to test our patience, [From.GetSpeciesName]."
 01_INTEGRATE_PROPOSE:0 "Subsume your nation into our empire, [From.GetSpeciesName]."

 01_INTEGRATE_ACCEPT_FRIENDLY:0 "The [Root.GetName] gladly accepts your generous offer to join with the [From.GetName], [From.GetRulerTitle] [From.GetRulerName]."
 01_INTEGRATE_ACCEPT_NEUTRAL:0 "Very well. The [Root.GetName] accepts integration into the [From.GetName]."
 01_INTEGRATE_ACCEPT_HOSTILE:0 "As much as it pains us to accept [From.GetSpeciesAdj] hegemony, we will."
 01_INTEGRATE_ACCEPT_DISMISSIVE:0 "We might accept [From.GetSpeciesAdj] rule, for a time."
 01_INTEGRATE_ACCEPT_PATRONIZING:0 "They grow up so fast... We will join you."
 01_INTEGRATE_ACCEPT_ANGRY:0 "You may have won this battle, but not the war."

 01_CANCEL_INTEGRATE_FRIENDLY:0 "But we have come so far together."
 01_CANCEL_INTEGRATE_NEUTRAL:0 "You wish to keep [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] and [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] apart?"
 01_CANCEL_INTEGRATE_HOSTILE:0 "The [From.GetName], failing to follow through? Cover us in pigmentation indicating shock and disbelief."
 01_CANCEL_INTEGRATE_DISMISSIVE:0 "Begone, then."
 01_CANCEL_INTEGRATE_PATRONIZING:0 "Bit off more than you could chew, little one?"
 01_CANCEL_INTEGRATE_ANGRY:0 "Never trust a [From.GetSpeciesName] to do a sentient being's job."
 01_CANCEL_INTEGRATE_PROPOSE:0 "We will cease integrating your nation for now."

 01_CANCEL_INTEGRATE_ACCEPT_FRIENDLY:0 "Disappointing, to be sure."
 01_CANCEL_INTEGRATE_ACCEPT_NEUTRAL:0 "Perhaps it is not the right time."
 01_CANCEL_INTEGRATE_ACCEPT_HOSTILE:0 "Pathetic."
 01_CANCEL_INTEGRATE_ACCEPT_DISMISSIVE:0 "Never mind."
 01_CANCEL_INTEGRATE_ACCEPT_PATRONIZING:0 "Thought so."
 01_CANCEL_INTEGRATE_ACCEPT_ANGRY:0 "Indecision and weakness are not admirable traits, [From.GetSpeciesAdj] fool."

 01_INSULT_PROPOSE:0 "Are you in great physical pain, or is that your thinking expression?"
 02_INSULT_PROPOSE:0 "The role of the [Root.GetName] is played out. Go where you belong from now on - into the dustbin of history!"
 03_INSULT_PROPOSE:0 "The [Root.GetName] is a nation of fools, worthy of nothing but contempt!"
 04_INSULT_PROPOSE:0 "Your pitiful nation is living on borrowed time. The [Root.GetName] will fall - it is inevitable."
 05_INSULT_PROPOSE:0 "We consider the [Root.GetName] to be one of the great accidents of the galaxy. It should never have been."
 06_INSULT_PROPOSE:0 "Perhaps there are star nations in this galaxy that are even more worthless than the [Root.GetName]. If so, we have yet to meet them."
 01_INSULT_PROPOSE_XENOPHOBE:0 "Your species seems to grow more and more disgusting for each passing day, [Root.GetSpeciesName]."
 02_INSULT_PROPOSE_XENOPHOBE:1 "Even for a loathsome xeno, your species is particularly vile, [Root.GetSpeciesNameInsult]."
 03_INSULT_PROPOSE_XENOPHOBE:0 "Your sickening species is definite proof that the universe has a sense of humor, [Root.GetSpeciesName]."
 04_INSULT_PROPOSE_XENOPHOBE:0 "You will forgive me if I dim my display, [Root.GetSpeciesName]. I simply cannot stand to look at your nauseating appearance."
 05_INSULT_PROPOSE_XENOPHOBE:1 "I can taste your stink, vile [Root.GetSpeciesNameInsult]. Every time I do, I fear that I've somehow been infected by it."
 06_INSULT_PROPOSE_XENOPHOBE:1 "Look at yourselves! What is that thing in your face, some kind of [Root.GetSpeciesMouthName]? Wait... is that even your face!? How can you not see that you [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] are an affront to nature?"
 07_INSULT_PROPOSE_XENOPHOBE:0 "Your so called [Root.GetName] is a nation of mutants, deviants and throwbacks... The fact that we have a common ancestry makes me sick!"
 01_INSULT_PROPOSE_PAC_MIL:0 "The ridiculous focus of the [Root.GetName] on all things military has us wondering if you're perhaps compensating for something."
 02_INSULT_PROPOSE_PAC_MIL:0 "How is it that your contemptible and warlike nation hasn't destroyed itself yet?"
 03_INSULT_PROPOSE_PAC_MIL:0 "Jingoist fools! Dismantle your military machine before you hurt someone with it!"
 04_INSULT_PROPOSE_PAC_MIL:0 "The belligerence of the [Root.GetName] is matched only by its stupidity. Can't you see that you are slaves to militarism?"
 01_INSULT_PROPOSE_MIL_PAC:0 "The cowardice of the [Root.GetName] is widely discussed in the [From.GetName]. How is it that you became such a spineless nation?"
 02_INSULT_PROPOSE_MIL_PAC:0 "What makes a being turn pacifist? Lust for gold? Power? Or were you just born with a heart full of pacifism? It's enough to make you sick."
 03_INSULT_PROPOSE_MIL_PAC:0 "Those unwilling to defend themselves have no right to exist. We do not expect the [Root.GetName] to survive the decade."
 04_INSULT_PROPOSE_MIL_PAC:0 "What a meek and deplorable little nation the [Root.GetName] is. The [From.GetName] would have crushed you long ago if we thought you worth the effort."
 01_INSULT_PROPOSE_MAT_SPI:0 "Can you tell us more about that silly religion you're so fond of in the [Root.GetName]? We could use a good laugh!"
 02_INSULT_PROPOSE_MAT_SPI:0 "How any rational, thinking being could embrace spiritualism is beyond us. Why is it that you cling to such primitive beliefs?"
 03_INSULT_PROPOSE_MAT_SPI:0 "We have seen through your charade. The so-called 'spiritualism' your government has embraced is nothing more than a devious attempt to control the minds and hearts of your people."
 04_INSULT_PROPOSE_MAT_SPI:0 "Everyone else is laughing at your absurd spiritual beliefs. Are you really so blind in the [Root.GetName] that you can't see this?"
 01_INSULT_PROPOSE_SPI_MAT:0 "What a dull and soulless place your materialistic nation must be. Tell me, have you invented a sense of humor yet? No? A pity."
 02_INSULT_PROPOSE_SPI_MAT:0 "For a nation that has embraced science and materialism, the [Root.GetName] is remarkably primitive. Is it due to bad luck or are you just stupid?"
 03_INSULT_PROPOSE_SPI_MAT:0 "The [Root.GetName] is a nation designed for computers and automatons, not breathing organics. Are you even capable of feeling emotion?"
 04_INSULT_PROPOSE_SPI_MAT:0 "The [Root.GetName] is a failed experiment. Its only worth is as a lesson to the rest of the galaxy on the dangers of embracing the cold and lifeless philosophy of materialism."
 01_INSULT_PROPOSE_COL_IND:0 "Is the [Root.GetName] even a real nation or just an anarchic gaggle of quarreling individuals? You must forgive me, but your political system, such as it is, makes it hard to tell."
 02_INSULT_PROPOSE_COL_IND:0 "So who is it that rules your amusing little star nation today? What a quaint notion, to "vote" someone into power! It will inevitably lead to your collapse, of course."
 03_INSULT_PROPOSE_COL_IND:0 "Your democratic ideals are a blight on this galaxy, and so is the [Root.GetName]."
 04_INSULT_PROPOSE_COL_IND:0 "What a selfish people you are, always putting your individual selves foremost. Individualism... ha! The [Root.GetName] will not survive the year."
 01_INSULT_PROPOSE_IND_COL:0 "Your brutal, totalitarian regime will eventually fall, and there will be a reckoning."
 02_INSULT_PROPOSE_IND_COL:0 "Have you even considered the notion of letting your citizens think for themselves? If you are frightened that it would lead to the end of the [Root.GetName]... you are right."
 03_INSULT_PROPOSE_IND_COL:0 "How sad that a totalitarian nation such as the [Root.GetName] can exist. It is an embarrassment to sentient beings everywhere."
 04_INSULT_PROPOSE_IND_COL:0 "The cruel oppression of the people living under the yoke of the [Root.GetName] has to end one day. Your collectivism will prove your undoing."
 01_INSULT_PROPOSE_PHO_PHI:0 "Your bizarre love of alien cultures is a sickness. Can't you see that?"
 02_INSULT_PROPOSE_PHO_PHI:0 "It is sickening to see how quick the [Root.GetName] is to embrace other cultures. Have you no self-respect?"
 03_INSULT_PROPOSE_PHO_PHI:0 "The perverse interest in alien cultures that is prevalent throughout the [Root.GetName] is an affront to the universe!"
 04_INSULT_PROPOSE_PHO_PHI:0 "It has become clear to us that your willingness to embrace alien cultures in the [Root.GetName] is because you never fostered one of your own."
 01_INSULT_PROPOSE_PHI_PHO:0 "You poor, bigoted fools. Why are you so afraid of that which is different?"
 02_INSULT_PROPOSE_PHI_PHO:0 "Our patience with your prejudices against other cultures is wearing thin. When will you be civilized enough to truly join the interstellar community?"
 03_INSULT_PROPOSE_PHI_PHO:0 "Your intolerant society brings shame to the entire [Root.GetName]."
 04_INSULT_PROPOSE_PHI_PHO:0 "The narrow-minded ignorance of the [Root.GetName] has blinded you. Do you not realize this?"
 
 01_INSULT_NEUTRAL:0 "You wouldn't dare!"
 02_INSULT_NEUTRAL:0 "What's that, you say? You have a "special" message for us?"
 03_INSULT_NEUTRAL:0 "You had something important to tell us?"
 04_INSULT_NEUTRAL:0 "Careful now. Let us not say things we can't take back..."
 01_INSULT_FRIENDLY:0 "Yes, friend? What was the important matter you wanted to discuss?"
 02_INSULT_FRIENDLY:0 "What's wrong, friends? Have we offended you in some way?"
 03_INSULT_FRIENDLY:0 "Please, tell us what is on your mind. What can we do for you?"
 04_INSULT_FRIENDLY:0 "We... we are still friends, aren't we?"
 01_INSULT_HOSTILE:0 "Have you come to beg our forgiveness?"
 02_INSULT_HOSTILE:0 "We will not suffer insults. Especially from the likes of you."
 03_INSULT_HOSTILE:0 "What is the meaning of this?"
 04_INSULT_HOSTILE:0 "Explain yourselves. What is it that you want?"
 01_INSULT_ACCEPT_NEUTRAL:0 "How dare you?! You will pay for this affront!"
 02_INSULT_ACCEPT_NEUTRAL:0 "This is outrageous! The [From.GetName] will not get away with this!"
 03_INSULT_ACCEPT_NEUTRAL:0 "I think you will find that we have long memories. This slight by the [From.GetName] will not soon be forgotten."
 04_INSULT_ACCEPT_NEUTRAL:0 "The [From.GetName] deeply regrets the immature and bellicose rancor being spewed by the [Root.GetName], which threatens to undermine the stability of the interstellar community."
 01_INSULT_ACCEPT_FRIENDLY:0 "If this is intended as a joke, it's in very poor taste!"
 02_INSULT_ACCEPT_FRIENDLY:0 "I... I don't... why would you say something like that?"
 03_INSULT_ACCEPT_FRIENDLY:0 "I see. It would appear that we were wrong about you after all."
 04_INSULT_ACCEPT_FRIENDLY:0 "This... this is highly unorthodox."
 01_INSULT_ACCEPT_HOSTILE:0 "Oh, you've done it now. This time you've really done it..."
 02_INSULT_ACCEPT_HOSTILE:0 "I would expect nothing less from you animals! We will remember this!"
 03_INSULT_ACCEPT_HOSTILE:0 "Do not think that we aren't keeping track of your affronts. The list is becoming very long."
 04_INSULT_ACCEPT_HOSTILE:0 "Impertinent scum! You will come to regret this!"
