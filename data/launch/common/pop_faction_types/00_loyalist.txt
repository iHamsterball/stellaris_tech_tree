# 
# The Loyalist-faction should always exist as it will be used as the standard faction for all Pops
# that have no strong feelings to join any other faction. Pops willingness to be in the
# Loyalist-faction will be reduced the less happy they are, meaning they are more willing
# to join any other faction.
